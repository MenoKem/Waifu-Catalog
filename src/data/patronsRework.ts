So you wish to have a Patron do you? Patrons typically demand a bit more personal effort from you then the company does. For some, it's not always worth the benefits they give out. Few Contractors appreciate how hands off the company is till their Patron demands entertainment they no longer wish to provide.

export const intro = `Patrons are immensely powerful beings that for one reason or another have offered to take you under their wing. While they are your Patron, you are their contractor. Why are they doing this you may ask? With infinite time, resources and power that contractors can achieve the question is: Why not? 
<p>Perhaps there is a cosmic betting pool on whose contractors will do the best, whether for gain or just bragging rights. Maybe some have a specific goal that you can be a cog in achieving. Others may be on vacation and simply desiring a good show. Whatever the case, they offer rewards for those who can satisfy their desires, and punishments for those who break their promises. Many Patrons make requests of their Contractor. These do not count against your mission limit.</p>

Patrons are generic for a reason. Make them fun and interesting for your story. By default, a Patron is a part of the company, however authors can choose instead to have Patrons as beings separate from the company that are offering a version of the catalog that they are backing.

      <p>The First Contractor gives those he takes under his wing direct support during Chargen. He will offer advice and is prepared to cover the price of your first Waifu, as long as they are Tier 5 or below. </p>

It is no secret that long lived beings crave adventure and excitement, and the Genie is willing to offer you a journey like no other in exchange for some entertainment. Now what is it that you truly desire?</i> 
      <p>The Isekai Genie will allow you to take up to three missions at a time rather than the default one the catalog normally allows. In addition to this, you gain an aura of adventure, and those with adventurous spirits will be drawn to you, making it easier to find traveling companions, as well as adversaries, along the way.</p>
      <p>However, it wouldn’t be an isekai adventure if you didn’t go seeking adventure. You cannot leave a world until you complete a local Standard or Grand mission in it. Accessing company spaces and taking a mission elsewhere are the only exceptions to this rule.</p>
      <p>Finally, the genie forbids you from purchasing Waifus. It isn’t an adventure if you don’t make a party yourself over the course of your journey.</p>

A few examples of their esoteric desires are a laugh, a concept, or a firstborn child. All of these have meanings they wish to comprehend. They are Tricksters, Scientists, and Unknowable entities in equal measure
      <p>Alternatively, they only adopt that Zen Fairy attitude when their contractors are around, as it’s really fun to mess with people when telling someone to acquire something so bizarre as a laugh.</p></i> 
      <p>In exchange for doing the odd jobs issued to you, the Fae are willing to double all credits you receive from missions. They will not double non-credit rewards, including IMG Tickets.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the Fae’s influence rubs off on Contractors they sponsor. Those under the patronage of the Fae lose the ability to overtly lie. Instead they must learn to conceal, misdirect and omit that which they know in the case they are put in a situation where they must do so. Though many have tried, no power, talent or amount of IMG tickets will allow you to regain the ability to directly lie to others.</p>

      <p>As a gift, take the Red and White Eye Orbs for free.  Whenever you join an invasion, the Devil grants you the ability to choose who you wish  to support. This may be the invader, the defender, or neither. The Devil's interference replaces your crimson or golden aura with an inky darkness instead, making it impossible for others to identify your allegiance. You will be a dark horse on the board that many may instead wish to eliminate in fear of you interfering with their plans.
