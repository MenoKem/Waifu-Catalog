  <p>This perk can also upgrade an item or effect that is intrinsically part of that member's Legend to Noble Phantasm status, including all the boosts associated with it (Immunity to mundane breakage, conceptual protections in theme of the item, etc). The form that the Noble Phantasm takes is frequently physical weaponry (e.g. swords, spears, bows) or support items (e.g. shields, rings, crowns). They can also be abstractions such as unique, often magical and/or supernatural abilities, unique or perhaps conceptual means of attack, curses, and even changes to the surrounding environments' physical or supernatural properties. This becomes their Primary Noble Phantasm, and they its owner.</p>
  <p>The power of a Noble Phantasm generally starts at roughly for the owner’s current Tier. As it is part of a still Living Legend, the power can be raised higher. Unlike most abilities, training does nothing to a Noble Phantasm’s power, only one's skill in wielding it . Its power is instead related to the story of its wielder, and deeds they accomplish using the Noble Phantasm.</p>
  <p>The expressed power of an invoked Noble Phantasm is such that an “average” release is directly comparable to a fully powered, fully charged similar effect as used by an average person of equivalent Tier, without the need for any charge or preparation. Secondary effects tied to a person’s story may manifest as secondary Phantasms, whose power is always at least a full tier weaker than their owner. A high level Noble Phantasm is equivalent to someone at the peak of the current tier, whilst the absolute most powerful can manifest power 1 tier higher than the owner’s current Tier. This explicitly does not allow a T10 to wield IMG tier level power.</p>
  <p>Invoking a Noble Phantasm drains the user of energy relative to the Tier and power of the effect invoked. Treat standard tier effects as roughly half the total energy capacity of a normal member of that Tier. Each increase in effective tier requires roughly 75% more energy/power than the previous, and each decrease in Tier cuts the energy cost by half. This cost can knock out or even kill the user if they do not have enough energy/mana/vitality when it is Invoked.</p>
  <p>This Perk may be purchased multiple times, with a limit of 1 per person. Once you have purchased this perk 10 times, all additional Demi-Servants that qualify automatically gain this perk without further purchase.</p>

  <p>Ruler class grants a significant boost to all of a companions abilities, making them stronger than any other class of servant, as well providing them with the ability to use Command Seals on other Servants and Demi-Servants. This boost on its own is not enough to boost a tier of a companion. Unlike a normal class, Ruler-class explicitly allows this to combine with boosts from other sources to upgrade a Tier, provided a Companion is already at the peak of their current Tier. This explicitly does not provide enough for a T10 to upgrade to IMG Tier.</p>
  <p>A Ruler-class may carry six additional sets of Seals on their body. These extra Seals are granted free as part of this perk, do not count towards the general command seal limit, regenerate independently from any others, and may have active charges transferred to you, or other retinue members that have Command Seals.</p>

A Demi-Servant may save their current class configuration as a Saint Graph, a metaphysical template that stores abilities and memories of that Demi-Servant. Switching classes using  Saint Graphs requires directly accessing a Saint Graph Library in which the Demi-Servant has already saved a copy of the Saint Graph they wish to switch to. If the companion does not have any saved Saint Graphs of the class they wish to switch to, they must first switch to that class normally to be able to save that class configuration as a Saint Graph for future use. 
  <p>The Saint Graph Library itself exists to hold these imprints separate from any Throne of Heroes. Its primary form exists as a large server-sized device placed in a secure pocket space, or other location if you do not have one. Secondary form is that of a high tech briefcase. Saved Graphs may also be accessed via an app on the Company provided phone.</p>
  <p>If you already possess Warranty Plan, this provides an additional way to restore anyone under a Warranty plan by resummoning them via a saved Graph. This method treats the delay for a revival by summoning as the cooldown from Warranty Plan or 24 hours, whichever is lower.  This requires direct access to the Saint Graph Library the information is stored in, and a summoning circle.</p>
  <p>If a waifu is mission-killed in such a way that Warranty Plan could be activated to force a respawn, you can instead instantly resummon said companion through a Saint Graph.</p>
