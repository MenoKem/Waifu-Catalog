<h3 class="font-bold text-lg">General Binding Rules</h3>
<p>All bindings ensure a companion's loyalty, friendship, and romantic and sexual interest in you, and nudge them in that direction toward your other companions. Bonds between your companions grow more quickly with increased interaction, but will not override familial relationships without significant pressure.</p>
<p>Companion obedience is not absolute. In general, they put the spirit of your orders over the letter. Strong-willed companions may elect to ignore disliked orders and follow their own initiative. More often, a competent companion whose moral alignment conflicts with an order’s means or ends will raise an objection and the two of you will have to argue it out.</p>
<p>Bound companions are also somewhat more likely, depending on their moral alignments, to consider “Just bind her and make her one of us” a valid solution to any problem involving a companion candidate. Even the purest of heart can find themselves seduced by the power to turn any enemy into a friend.</p>
<p>All bindings work equally well regardless of the user’s or target’s sex, gender, or orientation. If you change your binding method, any expansion you bought for the old one will be refunded at the standard rate. Like all company- supplied powers, bindings cannot be nullified, copied, or stolen.
</p>
<p>For safety reasons, all purchased companions and familiars are bound with one of the Stamp’s tattoos before delivery, unless you opt out of having any bindings. You can have no more than one binding method at any time. When you buy a new binding method, your previous one will be automatically refunded and disappear from existence; any physical or mental effects that the former binding actively maintained will fade over the next few days. Long-term “set and forget” effects, such as from Tempest Jewelry, the Hypnosis App, or Tantric Arts, will remain in their current state, as will the Stamp’s tattoos. The latter will merely become dormant (invisible and inert) while any higher binding is applied. Perks listed as Other Capture Methods are not bindings, and are thus compatible with each other and all bindings.
</p>
<p>If a companion or familiar was never Stamped, whether by you or before delivery, the use of any higher binding method will also give them a dormant tattoo; this is what marks them as one of your captures. Dormant tattoos turn active when higher bindings are removed. If you have any binding, but capture a companion using only Lures, the Stamp’s effects will apply regardless and the full tattoo will appear immediately.</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Arcane Links</h3>
<p>These are items, individuals, or actions with a strong metaphysical connection to the intended target of the spell, and one of the primary ways of acquiring Resonance. Common arcane links include a lock of the target's hair, a few drops of their blood, having heard their true name from their own lips, close relationships, or being their superior in a shared organization. The arcane link must have the appropriate level of metaphysical significance, particularly for larger targets. A piece of cobble from a street may allow you to target the street itself, but wouldn’t target the buildings, a city map wouldn’t let you target the city, but the key to the city could, a printout of a flag doesn’t have the mystical weight to target the associated nation, but the original, physical flag could. While line of sight and outright contact are several such links, they are ill suited for the greater arts.</p>
<p>One object, subject, or action can act as multiple kinds of Arcane Links, either to different potential targets or due having multiple significant connections to a single target.</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Resonance</h3>
<p>Resonance is the abstraction of the mystical power that has been gathered for a spell. Most forms of preparation will grant +1 Resonance, but particularly well attuned ones, such as a beloved mother of the target trying to hand over her daughter could provide +3 Resonance. Additional factors that can empower a ritual include, but are not limited to, active sex with the target, the taking of an individual’s virginity as part of the casting, the impregnation of the target, the target’s willingness to engage with the ritual, having an Element that aligns with the particular spell, or having someone with official authority over the target assist in casting the spell. </p>
<p>The strength of the most powerful caster in the Art has a meaningful impact. A silver-star (T7-9) caster would have +1 Resonance, while a T10 or Imaginary Tier would have +2 Resonance. While the primary caster - generally the most powerful individual - must maintain their effort for the duration of the casting, additional people actively assisting in the casting may increase its power. 2-9 additional casters grants +1 Resonance. Every additional Magnitude of casters grants an additional Resonance. For example, 10 - 99 additional casters would grant +2 Resonance, while 100 - 999 would grant +3.</p>
<p>Another common form of gaining mystic resonance is a prepared space for that specific type of spell. A ritual altar, intricate circles drawn upon the ground, or similar could grant +1 Resonance. An entire dedicated structure built to empower the ritual would grant +2 Resonance. Specific preparations upon the target themselves, such as inscribing specialized runes on them, or ritualistic purification or bondage, can also grant Resonance.</p>
<p>The final major source of Mystic Resonance are additional or particularly significant Arcane Links: things such as a direct blood relative of the target being involved in the casting, a beloved item/person of the target, a full pint of blood rather than a few drops, all the hair from a haircut rather than a single lock, or the entire City Hall to target a city. Each additional, significant Arcane Link is worth another +1 Resonance. A particularly significant amount of the arcane link increases the Resonance it grants by 1. These must be actively used in the casting in order to add their power, such as dancing through the halls of a building, or praying over blood.</p>
<p>If the Arcane Link is sacrificed, consumed, or otherwise destroyed as part of the casting, it counts for an additional +1 Resonance. Being able to involve the target directly in the ritual casting would count for +4 Resonance. Arcane links that require a meaningful amount of effort from the caster may also grant additional resonance.  While a billionaire could purchase an item for $1,000 for no additional Resonance, the same item for the same price could grant +1 Resonance if it’d been purchased by someone in poverty, where that price represents a month’s labor. Artificial constraints to increase effort function appropriately, as it is the effort involved that matters.</p>
<p>While spells take one hour to cast by default, more Resonance may be gained by spending longer to work the spell. A 2-8 hour ritual would grant +1 Resonance, whereas a ritual from Sunrise to Sunset (Or vice versa, about 9-12 hours) would grant +2 Resonance, and a ritual from Sunrise to Sunrise (24 hours) would provide +4 Resonance. Alternatively, by spending Resonance, the casting time for a spell may be reduced to 30 minutes for 1 Resonance, 10 minutes for 2 Resonance, or 1 minute for 3 Resonance.</p>
<p>All Arts may be improved in the following ways with excess Resonance.</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
<li>Arts will normally only target a single individual, object, or structure. Resonance may be spent to target everything near the target. Spending 1 Resonance may also be spent to allow the spell to affect everything within 1 meter of the target(s). Additionally, 1 Resonance may allow a spell to target both the arcane link itself and the thing which it acts as a link to.</li>
<li>Resonance may be spent to force an arcane link to connect to an ill-suited target or one several conceptual steps away. The weaker the conceptual connection between the link and the intended target of the spell, the more Mystic Resonance is required. For example, 1 Resonance could allow someone’s blood to act as a targeting link for one of their close relatives. 2 Resonance could allow a piece of brick from a building to target every building on that street. 7 Mystical Resonance may be spent to target an entire world from a clod of dirt from said world. Additional resonance based on arcane links must be related to the intended target, not the source of the inappropriate link.</li>
<li>Adding exceptions or specific targets to standing or area of effect spells. Every Resonance spent on this allows for another such filter. The caster must possess an arcane link related to the filter applied, such as a deed to target buildings owned by someone on the paper, a tuft of red hair to target redheads, or a computer to target AIs. </li>
<li>Spells with an appropriate Arcane Link may target anyone in the same dimension or reality by default. Targeting someone from a connected reality (such as one in the same local multiverse or from your Pocket Apartment) requires an additional 3 Resonance, while targeting someone from an entirely unrelated reality requires 5 Resonance.</li>
<li>Spells, once cast, may not be changed or altered. However, non-instantaneous spells may be canceled by the caster (and the Contractor, if they are not the caster). Arts with limited durations may have 2 Resonance spent to make their duration indefinite.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Art of Binding</h3>
<p>The initial perk comes with the knowledge of the Art of Binding. These Arts compel the target to take or avoid a certain kind of action. The more specific the action, the more powerful the compulsion. For example, a compulsion to have sex is not as effective as a compulsion to give blowjobs, and aiming these compulsions at specific subjects requires an arcane link. A target resisting the compulsions of the Art will only cause them to increase in severity. If the compulsion is to perform an action, the spell ends once they complete it, or within a week otherwise. The same compulsion cannot be stacked, though overlapping compulsions will have increased effect. Recasting the same spell using more Resonance to give it greater strength may supplant the original. What follows is a list of common uses and Resonance costs for the Art. Skilled Contractors often devise their own Arts following the themes of Binding.</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
<li><b>Art of Shackles</b>: 1-5 Resonance to directly prohibit or require an action. The widest variance in Resonance occurs here, as greater compulsions and broader categories of action demand greater Resonance costs.</li>
<li><b>Art of Chastity</b>: 1 Resonance to affect a target’s sexual ability or responses. This Art is most commonly used to prevent orgasm, prevent arousal from decreasing, or to find certain stimuli/situations arousing.</li>
<li><b>Art of the Leash</b>: 1 Resonance to give the target an urge to travel to a location or subject</li>
<li><b>Art of the Blindfold</b>: 4 Resonance to prevent the target's awareness of a specific stimulus unless it actively interacts with them or is deliberately brought to their attention.</li>
<li><b>Art of Bonds</b>: 3 Resonance to apply a compulsion towards a certain emotion.</li>
<li><b>Art of Enslavement</b>: Costs 3 Resonance for blue- star targets, 5 Resonance for copper-stars, 7 for silver-stars, 9 for gold-stars, and 11 for Imaginary Tiers. Experiencing this Art is emotionally intense for the target during the casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the completed Stamp will appear on them in a place of the casters choosing and the target will be captured. You have +5 Resonance for arts targeting that individual from now on, as they are mystically always willing and involved in the ritual.</li>
</ul>

<p>This permanent magical tattoo instills only the mental effects common to all bindings. To capture targets, you may apply this tattoo using a thumb-sized ink stamp. You can only have one stamp at a time, and only you and your retinue members can perceive the stamp when it’s not in use. The inked part, on one end, contains the tattoo’s core, a circular design that serves as your emblem.</p>
<p>Stamping requires 3 seconds of sustained contact with the target’s skin, from the stamper’s perception, to start the tattoo-creation process. You must apply enough pressure to make the ink transfer properly. The most popular stamping sites are typically the pubic region, lower back, or back of the neck. Newly-applied tattoos require 72 hours to ramp up to their full effect, from the perception of the person stamped.</p>
<p>During the ramp-up period, additional ink will fill itself in around your emblem to form a much more elaborate design, about the size of the subject’s palm, that represents her history and personality. Captured subjects and people they know will not notice a tattoo-in-progress until it completes itself, at which point they’ll rationalize away its sudden appearance. If a tattoo’s location is ever damaged or severed, its effects will continue and it will reappear when the skin is regenerated or the body part replaced.</p>
<p>Stamped targets only count as captured at the end of this period, when the tattoo completes. Completed tattoos are always perceptible. A stamp’s location on a target’s body may be repositioned after the fact through the company app; a generated 3D model of the target serves as a reference.</p>
<p>The stamp never runs out of ink and cannot be used accidentally. If you are stamped, by yourself or another, it will only have cosmetic effects. If one of your subjects marks someone new with it, the newbie will feel its effects as if you had used it on her yourself. The anti-loss, -theft, and -destruction measures on the company’s smart device also apply to this stamp.</p>`,

    <p>These magitech jewels reward obedience through pleasure. You receive one new piece of jewelry each day, up to a limit of 5 unused pieces at a time. This limit increases by one for each member of your retinue, including yourself, currently wearing this jewelry. This binding will be applied to purchased companions before delivery.</p>
    <p>When you purchase this binding, select one type of jewelry to give to your companions: choker, ring, (bracelet and anklet), (armlet and thighlet), (headpiece: crown, tiara, hood, etc.), or (facepiece: mask, veil, visor, etc.). The other options may be purchased with a later perk. Tempest bands may be leather, silk, or metal, depending on jewelry type. Aside from the facepiece, all Tempest items have a central mounted gem: ruby, orange topaz, citrine, emerald, sapphire, amethyst, alexandrite, and clear and black diamonds are all available. Facepieces are highly variable, but generally have your emblem on the front. Tempest Rings are designed to be worn on the fingers, not anywhere else.</p>
    <p>Wearers’ libido is highly enhanced, as is submissiveness to both their masters and any more dominant members of the same retinue. Several options are available for punishing disobedience, including induced emotional numbness or release denial for a set time. You are your own master and not subject to any unwanted side- effects of your own equipment.</p>
    <p>When a Tempest item’s latch (if it has one) is first closed around a wearer, the latch disappears and manual removal becomes impossible as the jewelry automatically activates. If an active jewelry piece is ever broken, it will repair itself completely the next time it isn’t observed by anyone who isn’t in your retinue, and may not otherwise be warped away. If a wearer dematerializes, swaps bodies, or otherwise transforms away from a standard humanoid height and build, the jewelry will disappear with, into, or otherwise follow the wearer for the duration.</p>
    <p>Intentional damage or removal of a wearer's own Tempest item becomes unthinkable after one full week (168 hours), via a gradual process of rationalization, physical comfort, the automatic reward and punishment system, and, in extreme circumstances, short-term memory loss. Captures are finalized at this point if no other effort is spent. The process can be accelerated to as few as three days (72 hours), however, if the wearer loses all will to resist. Removing a jewelry from a subject before that point will stop their capture process, voiding all progress. Any punishment system you program for jewelry wearers will start working from the moment the latch is first closed, not just when the capture is finalized. If you (the contractor) wear a Tempest item, you may deactivate and remove it at any time.</p>
    <p>You may deactivate any of your retinue's jewelry through the associated software, installed as an app on your smart device. The latch will reappear and may then be undone (and the jewelry removed) normally. Your retinue may use other app features added by expansion perks, but cannot perceive the deactivation option. (They may still use it if directly ordered.) This app will uninstall itself if you trade in the Jewelry for a more advanced Binding. This is company software and benefits from all such protections.</p>

    <p>Each worn Tempest piece can now project invisible, semi-permeable barrier shields. These shields are accompanied by purely-aesthetic “armor” projections, matching the Tempest pieces they’re projected from: leather to leather, metal to metal, as well as the gemstone color. Within that determined color scheme, the projected armor can have any appearance. This can be changed manually in the app. As the actual protection comes from the shield, it remains just as effective regardless of how much skin is concealed. These projections are physical and can catch on thick or loose clothing. For best results, skintight undersuits or outright nudity (aside from the Tempest pieces) are recommended.</p>
    <p>The shields from this perk do not benefit from any durability added to the Tempest pieces that project them. If a shield section takes too much damage too quickly, the shield will fail and the accompanying “armor” will shatter into light. A broken shield will only reactivate once it has a full charge.</p>
    <p>Shields have three basic settings. At the weakest level, a shield will evenly cover the entire body, which can withstand direct fire from a high-caliber heavy machine gun for three seconds before failing. Without additional stress, a broken shield will recharge after ten seconds.</p>
    <p>At the middle level, the shield will concentrate around a single body part that one of its components is projected from: headpiece and facepiece to the entire head, bracelets separately to each hand and forearm, necklace or waist chains (from Shackles) to the torso, etc. A full set will cover the entire body and allow the full use of this mode. Rings can assist with this mode if a non-ring piece is worn, but will not protect the hands individually. At this level, a shield can withstand a single direct hit from a modern battleship’s main cannon before failing. When this shield breaks, it will recharge after three hours.</p>
    <p>The highest level is an emergency barrier that requires at least 6 worn Tempest pieces to activate. This barrier can take only a single strike before failing, but will always take that strike, no matter how powerful it is. The barrier will then linger around the user, providing 1 second of temporary invincibility before it fades completely. This barrier must be manually triggered or programmed with Expert Runes: Logic, and takes a full day (24 hours) to recharge.</p>
    <p>On the lower two modes, each additional Tempest piece that an individual wears will add its base protection to the first, as well as a +5% modifier to the total shield protection. In these two modes, all active shields will break and recharge as one. The emergency barrier has a different form of durability: each additional shield is simply another hit that the wearer can take. Emergency shielding will fail as individual layers, with only a single layer recharging at a time. Individual shields that break in this mode will remain broken for the other two modes as well and not contribute to them until they’ve fully recharged.</p>

    <p>After the user is captured, you can shift which mind is in control at any point along sliders from one to the other. Gradients along this slider represent fusion states between the two subjects. With Body Runes and Mind Runes, you can also control which individual aspects of the two subjects are emphasized, with each perk enabling physical or mental fine-tuning, respectively.</p>`,

    <p>Tempest items now have a variety of mundane uses. The bracelets are now smart, with many electronic functions beyond a basic clock (digital or analog, depending on taste) and calculator. Automatic translation gives a wearer the ability to speak any language that you also speak, plus the standard and/or trade languages of any place they visit. This knowledge persists after they leave the area where the language is spoken.</p>
    <p>Any Tempest facepiece in use by your retinue will now have a heads-up display with a variety of features and layouts that you can enable, disable, or modify as desired. As a contractor, your own facepiece may also wirelessly connect to your company smart device. If you have Designer Set, the heads-up display displayed from a Tempest facepiece will also show the wearer’s current shield integrity and remaining recharge time. This may be disabled.</p>
    <p>A communications and monitoring app allows you to track your subjects’ locations and vitals and speak with them (and them with each other) remotely from any distance, even between different multiverses. These comms are not telepathic and will not work without actual speech or third-party thought-to-comms devices, limiting their use with thighlets and anklets. Tempest facepieces are highly recommended for this purpose. If you have Assuming Direct Control, the comms will become quasi- telepathic, converting intended thoughts to comms, and vice versa, for any retinue member who wears at least a Tempest facepiece.</p>
    <p>A disguise app can temporarily shift the wearer’s apparent race (human, kitsune, vulcan, etc.) and phenotype to blend in better with the local populace. This app cannot emulate abilities that the wearer cannot perform normally. These disguises are not customizable and simply reflect what the wearer would look like if they were born as that race. You may only save one disguise at a time into each wearer’s profile.</p>`,

    <p>Tempest items may now apply direct physical transformations to your retinue. Take Body Tune-Up, Everlasting Talent, Athletic Talent, and one copy of Body Defense for free. Every valid physical parameter for a member of the wearer's race (human, kitsune, vulcan, etc.) may be altered, from age, height, and gender to muscle density and sexual characteristics. This also applies to you, if you wear a Tempest item, and wearers who are counted among your subjects. The disguises created using Basic Runes may now be customized.</p>
    <p>A wearer's race may also be changed, on a deeper level than the disguises from this perk’s prerequisite, but only if you already have a natural example of the target race in your retinue. “Natural example” includes the results of Power Swap, but not examples created through Template Stacking or this feature. This perk cannot emulate the effects of party-wide Heritage perks such as Dragon Thrall.</p>
    <p>The jewelry app now includes configuration pages for every wearer of active jewelry. Parameters may be adjusted here, mostly using sliders from 0% (typically the minimum value for a healthy human) to 100%. A jewelry piece’s central gem will visibly glow while a transformation progresses, and more brightly if the transformation is faster or more intense. Aggressive Initiations will hasten this perk’s effects on all targets, regardless of the subject’s capture state.</p>
    <p>For example, hair length uses a linear scale of 1% = 2 cm, while other assets scale exponentially: +100% = 20x the mass. For the average adult human female, a breast measurement of 0% is about 100 g for each breast, 50% is about 350 g, and 100% is about 1.5 kg; full charts for Tempest sizes are available elsewhere. Height instead uses a multiplier relative to 168cm, with an initial range for humans from 7/8x (147 cm) to 1.25x (210 cm).</p>
    <p>You may save an unlimited number of presets for each wearer and switch between them at any time. If a wearer has a defined alternate form (not a generalized shapeshifter), all of their forms will automatically be saved as presets. Additionally, any number of disguises made by this perk’s prerequisite may now be saved as presets. "Exactly how the wearer appeared when the jewelry was first worn, even if the wearer’s original sizes were beyond this perk’s normal limits," is always available as a default preset. Any changes made to this preset will instead output an otherwise- identical copy as a new preset. Deactivating a Tempest item will restore the wearer to their original appearance, unless you desire otherwise.</p>
    <p>Any sufficiently-disabling transformation that is applied to you will have an automatic time limit of 48 hours so you don’t get stuck. If you reactivate that transformation within 10 minutes, the time limit will be doubled each time until your streak ends. You may set a shorter limit if you like.</p>
    <p>If you have Absolute Order, the limits of this perk’s body modification are vastly raised. The more often and determinedly any wearer resists your orders, the higher the upper limit for all wearers’ parameters will increase. This will also decrease the lower limits for certain parameters, such as height. This limit’s increase has no hard cap, only a soft cap from your capture targets’ ability to maintain resistance to your orders. These effects apply even if the wearer is not yet fully captured. Absolute Order also allows this perk’s regular transformations to apply to wearers who are not yet captured.</p>
    <p>Absolute Order also makes racial hybridization viable, with no theoretical limit on how many races you can hybridize into one individual. However, the result having all of the strengths of both sides and none of their weaknesses is only guaranteed when there are only two donor races present. More complex combinations are increasingly unreliable. Party-wide Heritage perks such as Dragon Thrall will not count against the hybridization limit, nor will pseudo-races that already freely hybridize, such as most varieties of cyborg, demigod, vampire or lycanthrope. Fandom-specific pseudo-races are noted in the relevant Setting Specific Rules.</p>
    <p>Most measurements become physically unwieldy past 160% and very little testing was performed beyond 300%. Some form of weight reduction or strength boost, whether magical, technological, or otherwise, is highly recommended for such hyper sizes.</p>

    <p>Your jewelry app now has a fully-functional programming suite. Instead of only inputting changes by your own will, the suite lets you create macros for Tempest pieces. A wide array of conditionals, operators, flags, triggers, scopes, variables, and anything else you might need are all included.</p>
    <p>The types of effects available are determined by which other Tempest Rune perks you have. You might set your waifus’ races to shift with each year of the Eastern Zodiac, program new sub-personalities with set triggers for when each one is in control, or filter their common sense to believe that hentai-isms are the normal way of things. If you can imagine and code it, you can do it.</p>
    <p>Previous experience with programming is not required. The suite contains clear tutorials, tooltips on everything, and a simple and intuitive interface, and will walk you through debugging with exactly the right amount of detail to fit your skill level. Take Science Talent for free.</p>
    <p>If you have Advanced Runes: Mind, standing orders may also be edited, deleted, or copy-pasted to new subjects quickly, cleanly, and across any distance. This also applies to the issuing of new orders, but cannot be used on wearers who are not yet fully captured.</p>
    <p>If you have Designer Set, you can program changes to the “armor” projections in the app instead of just relying on manual edits. Shield Break status is additionally useful as a trigger for other effects, including the Tempest piece itself detaching from its wearer. If enabled, detachment can occur any number of times, until the wearer only has one piece left. If you also have Jewels of Discord, detached Tempest pieces will gain that perk’s lure effect, counting separately from the one-at-a-time limit for unused jewels. The lure effect will continue to apply to the detached jewelry until it is worn.</p>

This cannot be undone manually.

    <p>Though Expert Runes: Logic, you can also define procs. A proc is any effect with a set chance of triggering from a particular kind of action, whether offensive, defensive, or support. Breathing and other natural requirements are not significant enough actions for a proc, but a single trigger pull and one second at full sprint both qualify. The stronger the effect compared to the enchanter and user, and the more common the base action, the lower the maximum proc rate. All proc rates from Tempest items are capped at 33%. Each tempest piece can have no more than one proc effect at a time.</p>`,
    desc: `
    <p>The Tempest enchantment suite is now fully open for use by your retinue’s enchanters and artificers. In general, the creation of stronger effects demands more skill and personal power from the enchanter, while their use requires more personal power from the wearer. A recipe library for all of your retinue’s known enchantments is also included. The native capabilities of every enchanter and artificer within your retinue will automatically be added to this library.</p>
    <p>Each tempest piece can now have up to three discrete enchantments. As with Spark Runes, our systems count the capabilities of “Sufficiently Advanced” technology as enchantments, often multiple distinct ones on the same item. If “the entire capability of a single existing item” would be three or more discrete enchantments when rebuilt from scratch, it will instead take up the Tempest piece’s entire enchantment capacity.</p>
    <p>Previous experience with enchanting is not required. The suite contains clear tutorials, tooltips on everything, and a simple and intuitive interface, and will walk you or your subject(s) through debugging with exactly the right amount of detail to fit your skill level. Take Soul Talent and Engineering Talent for free.</p>
    <p>All enchantments that we’ve documented across the multiverse tend to fall into a few distinct categories: passive, automatic, toggles, and active abilities, as well as procs (see below). Dream Runes is compatible with all five. Most common passive effects are redundant with Body or Mind Runes or Designer Set. New options include, but are not limited to, elemental and status resistances. Common automatic effects include “Slow Fall” and “Reflect Projectiles;” these are inactive unless needed. Toggled and active abilities are generally direct spell-like effects. These can be defensive, such as “Bunker” or “Shell,” supportive, such as “Inspire” or “Scan,” or offensive, such as “Icicle Spear” or “Tornado.”</p>
    <p>If you have Golden Idol, you can deconstruct an objectified subject of Tier 3 or higher into an enchantment recipe in your library. The subject-turned-recipe is neither alive nor dead, only data that can be freely copied into any number of Tempest pieces. Recipes cannot be sold, will not trigger Warranty Plan, and cannot be restored to a body while even one copy of their enchantment remains in place. Recipes are not aware of any time that passes while they remain in that state. If you have the relevant Talent Sharing, and restore a recipe to physical form, any use of a recipe will count as training for the original subject in the recipe’s associated ability.</p>

<p>You gain a semi-sapient cape of solidified magic that acts as an extension of your will. It shifts and transforms at a thought, even unconscious ones. By draping it over or wrapping up a waifu with it, you are able to infuse your target with your will and bind them to it.</p>
<p>This cape is subject to the same protections as the company smart device. It can shift its form and texture into a wide variety of shapes and imitate any other outfit, ropes, tendrils, hands, blades, and similar forms. The constructs of the Shroud may have the textures and forms of textiles like leathers, latex, or other forms of clothing. The shroud is extremely durable and capable of significant amounts of strength and speed, and you gain a form of tactile feedback from it.</p>
<p>Once completely infused, the waifu becomes one of your Shroud-bound. A newly Shroud-bound waifu’s clothes and makeup are absorbed into a cloak of her own, subordinate to your Shroud, and replaced with a new thematic style in line with your tastes and the personal mark of your stamp. A Shroud-bound waifu will always consider her cloak her most comfortable outfit, but she may still dismiss it and wear normal outfits at any time.</p>
<p>Both you and the waifu will be able to manipulate her outfit much like you can with your Shroud, though your will supersedes hers in such manners. These powers are innate abilities, granted by the Shroud, and do not require any magical talent. Altogether, this is enough to push any blue-star subject up to Tier 4 or any copper-star up one tier, but is not a significant gain for higher tiers. Your own rating immediately increases to Tier 5, if it wasn’t already, and can increase further as you train with the Shroud and discover new uses.</p>
<p>A new Shroud capture gains a subconscious awareness of your activity and needs. They may even respond to orders you haven’t consciously given yet. They will greatly struggle to go against your direct orders, and even the strongest-willed subjects will be unable to go against your intent once bound. Additionally, the infusion will shift Shroud-bound companions’ figures to your tastes.</p>
<h4 class="font-semibold text-md">Shroud: Capturing</h4>
<p>To capture a target, you or your Shroud must maintain contact with them or one of their projections until you’ve infused enough of your will, whether through the target wearing an outfit your Shroud has been transformed into, being cocooned by your Shroud’s constructs, or similar. As a general rule, the more of your Shroud is focused on, inside of, or otherwise in contact with your target, the less time it takes. The greater the power, will, or resistance your target has, the longer it will take.</p>
<p>With the entirety of your Shroud around a target, even if they put their all into the struggle, it will usually take less than a minute for a blue-star subject, under ten minutes for a copper-star subject, an hour for a silver-star subject, three hours for a gold-star subject, and 12 hours for a TX subject. Lesser amounts of your Shroud in contact with a target, or only intermittent contact, will extend the time required, up to years.</p>
<p>Other factors can reduce the required time. Examples include the number of orifices your Shroud has penetrated, any of your essence/fluids you have inside her, or if she’s unconscious, been recently defeated by you or your retinue, having sex with your or your retinue, or consenting to the bind. As a general rule, each additional factor reduces the time required to complete the infusion by half. A willing and aware (but not necessarily informed or ‘unassisted’ consent) target can make the process functionally instantaneous regardless of their personal power.</p>
<p>Until she is bound, your accumulated will within her will slowly dissipate whenever she loses contact with your Shroud. It takes approximately a month for the process to completely reset for a waifu who’s just short of being fully captured. Shroud-bound do not count as your Shroud for the purposes of binding new targets. Direct contact with one will, however, delay the fading of any will you've already built up within her.</p>
<p>If a target has an already-existing mental or spiritual connection to other bodies or people, the shroud can follow that connection to bind everyone on it at once. Examples of this include the Misaka Network, divine avatars or those who’ve taken mortal hosts, and multi-summon Servants like Gemini, Valkyrie, or Anne and Mary. Mere followers or even clerics of a god do not count.</p>
<h4 class="font-semibold text-md">Shroud: Failure?</h4>
<p>With only the basic Shroud, the bind can fail to take in subjects that have too much personal power, compared to your own, at the moment of attempted binding. This will ignore the subject’s consent and even purchase status.</p>
<p>Consenting subjects whose bindings fail will still be captured and marked with a stamp tattoo, so you can make a later attempt with the Shroud. Non-consenting subjects will break free completely, denying you their capture credits until a successful attempt is made.</p>
<p>Subjects who are already shroud-bound will remain so, even if they become strong enough that you would be unable to re-bind them. This includes the upgrades from capturing a character “early” and the expiration of any step 5 modifiers to effective tier..</p>
`,
    additionalDesc: `
<h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-center">Hen-SHIN!</h3>
<p>If you have Pocket Space, you and your shroud-bound subjects may store additional outfits within the Shroud and quick-change in and out of them with a thought. The Shroud will automatically envelop these outfits, reinforcing them with the wearer’s power and palette-swapping them (for the duration) to match the shroud’s aesthetics. At the most extreme, heavy power armor can look and feel like a maid costume while retaining its full capabilities. This is most relevant for existing enchanted gear or otherwise super outfits, such as Life Fibers, power armor, or magical girl uniforms.</p>
<p>Gear that is held rather than worn may also be stored this way, but the palette swap effect is far weaker.</p>

<p>Congratulations! Your Shroud has been upgraded to the elemental manifestation type! Choose one element for your personal Shroud from the list in the Shroud Elements section. (Your retinues’ cloaks are not affected.) No longer purely physical, the Shroud is an elemental manifestation of your will, granting you a noticeable buff to your affinity with that element, as well as allowing you to generate and control significant amounts of it.</p>
<p>Your Shroud’s manifestation is always intense and obvious, such as a black void for Fearful Shrouds, burning flames or magma for a Volcanic Shroud, or a seemingly star-filled cosmos for the Void Shroud. As an extension of your will, it will only harm that which you wish it to harm. You may take control of a natural manifestation of your element by mixing in some of your Shroud into it. Manifestations of the element with a will of their own must be infused with your will the same way a waifu must. However, a willing manifestation may allow you to manipulate them, such as using a Cyber Shroud to repair a willing gynoid. Willful manifestations must either be bound like any other capture or released when you have no further need of their substance.</p>
<p>These elemental shapes and tendrils must be contiguous with you or each other. Portions of Shroud that lose contact begin to dissipate, generally within ten to thirty seconds. Your waifus, their Cloaks, and waifus in multiple bodies all count as “you” for the purposes of Shroud sustenance. As an example, you can create a ring with the Xeric Shroud that would quickly crumble into nothingness if it left your body, but it would not if one of your waifus wore it.</p>
<p>Your Shroud can only be damaged by things which could feasibly harm the element itself, such as water affecting the Volcanic Shroud while physical strikes cannot, or gravitational effects damaging the Void Shroud. Even non-physical elements such as light and shadow are capable of becoming tangible, such as by becoming the physical cloak once more, though by doing so they can be damaged by physical forces.</p>
<p>Finally, you get Body Tune-Up and Athletic and Soul Talents for free. Each specific element, additionally, provides additional free Basic Talents and/or Defenses, as specified.</p>`,

<p>Select a member of your retinue. They are now shroud-bound, bypassing any failure chance., with a cloak that has elemental properties much like your own. Unless you deign to allow them an element you personally possess, one will be extrapolated from their current affinities and hypothetical developmental trajectories. Your waifus may have unique elements not found on the standard list, whether hybridized from standard elements or entirely new. If you buy this perk for a waifu when you purchase her, she will be shroud-bound before delivery, bypassing any failure chance.</p>
<p>In this way, your waifu will gain all the benefits like your own Elemental Shroud, that is, aesthetic harmonization for their constructs and cloak, an affinity for the element in other power systems, and the ability to generate and control said element. Unlike you, retinue members may only have a single element. This increases the Shroud tier boost for your retinue members to +3 for blue-stars, +2 for copper, and +1 for silver. Your retinue members who benefit from this perk do not receive the free Talents or Defenses that you get from Elemental Shroud or each particular element.</p>

This bypasses the usual limitation against your retinue members binding others using your shroud, but requires a powerful multitasking ability or extreme amount of practice to do so effectively.</p>

<p>You and your companions with elemental shrouds can access each other’s elements through the sympathetic bond your Shroud represents. On a basic level, drawing on another’s Element allows you to generate and manipulate things within their purview as if the element was your own, complete with aesthetic palette swaps and altered material profiles as appropriate.</p>
<p>Affinities granted by someone else’s element, however, are capped by the intimacy (or at least, the intensity) of one’s relationship with them, which can complicate attempts to squeeze waifus for power. Conversely, maximizing social links through careful harem management (or blunt mind control) will allow even diametrically opposed and incompatible themes to be reconciled and harmonized with each other as one through the strength of shared affinities.

<p>Take Psychic Talent and a copy of Talent Sharing for all eligible Basic Talents you own, for free. Previously- purchased copies of Talent Sharing will continue to apply to non-shroud retinue members.</p>
<p>Skill at manipulating constructs and phenomena is tracked separately and individually for each theme. Juggling and utilizing multiple themes at once is another skill that you can master.</p>
<p>Finally, this perk enhances your ability to project your own Shroud through shroud-bound subjects, to the point of being able to, temporarily, completely override their elements with your own, whether your original element or additional purchases from Prismatic Shroud. This only applies to subjects who benefit from Complementary Colors.</p>`,

<p>Your Shroud has been upgraded into a gaseous aura and its manifestations no longer need to be obvious and intense. A Volcanic Shroud no longer needs to create flames, but instead be a temperature change; the Primal Shroud can create and manipulate bacteria and viruses, the Cyber Shroud can affect purely digital code, etc.</p>
<p>You gain an additional sense related to the element(s) of your Shroud within your aura, though reading and understanding it will take practice. The Cyber Shroud may let you access wifi and bluetooth devices, or you can feel spatial distortion with the Void. You may infuse yourself with your element, increasing your strength, speed, and durability significantly.</p>
<p>While the rules for contiguous manifestation are still in effect, the Shroud does not need to have the same intensity across the entirety of it. As long as you are able to understand how your element can be expressed in non-obvious ways in the air around you, such as changing a room’s humidity or brightness or creating slight spatial distortions, you will be able to manifest intense examples of your element in apparent midair around you.</p>
<p>To reiterate, with an intense manifestation of your Shroud enveloping a target, no matter how hard they resist, binding them will generally take a minute, ten minutes, an hour, three hours, and twelve hours for a blue-star, copper-star, silver-star, gold-star, and TX waifu respectively. Waifus within your ambient aura are still in contact with your Shroud and may still be bound by it, but the process will take much longer. If a waifu is exposed only to these milder effects, binding a member of each category will generally take hours, days, weeks, months, and years, respectively.</p>`,

This process is instant if performed on a shroud-bound retinue member and has the same possibility of failure as standard Shroud capturing.</p>
    <p>The target’s skills, and any traits and abilities that match a Shroud or Heritage Element that you’ve purchased for yourself, will be copied to your true form.

    desc: `<p>An additional app is added to your company provided Smart Device, which is capable of entrancing, hypnotizing, and subverting the minds of targets. Individuals caught in this hypnosis become increasingly more suggestible, and will be entranced, losing conscious awareness of things outside of the screen and not consciously remembering anything experienced while so entranced, staring blankly at the screen with rapt attention. People that are entranced can be broken out of it by a physical or social shock, such as someone calling their name loudly, shoving them, or severely needing to go to the bathroom. It takes a few moments of awareness of the display to entrance someone, and thus individuals resistant to looking at the display can look away.</p>
    <p>Every hour someone is being actively entranced will increase their Hypnotic Depth by 1. Hypnotic Depth is an abstraction of a target’s susceptibility to further suggestion and control. The Contractor themselves are inoculated against the viewing of their own hypnotic displays.
    </p>
    <p>At every ten Hypnotic Depth an individual’s psyche will reach a Breakpoint, a barrier to accessing and controlling more of their consciousness. An individual’s Hypnotic Depth will not increase past this point until the target does something they would normally be resistant to while outside of the trance. Each additional Breakpoint past the first requires a more ‘severe’ infraction than before, as perceived by the target. At every breakpoint, new methods of control over a target's psyche will open up. New orders or changes to a target’s psyche requires that they are in the entranced state at the time.
    </p>
    <p>While the Hypnosis App is described in terms of an app on a phone, the exact form it takes is as varied as the available forms of Smart Devices, such as mystic orbs, omnitools, and magic books are all perfectly viable conveyors of the effects of the Binding.

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
    <li><b>At Hypnotic Depth 1-10</b>, you are able to Compel the target, nudging them towards a preferred outcome, but one they could feasibly do. While they are entranced, they will answer questions as if you were a trusted confidant.</li>
    <li><b>At Hypnotic Depth 11-20</b>, you have further control over the target, as if you had significant authority over them which they respect and/or fear. You may leave commands for the target to ignore specific stimuli outside of the trance, unless it actively shocks them out of such a state, such as ignoring a friend until they shout their name from up close, or ignoring someone groping them until they’re spanked.</li>
    <li><b>At Hypnotic Depth 21-30</b>, the ease of inducing the entranced state, and the difficulty of breaking them out of it, increases significantly. You are able to create emotional states in the target based on specific stimuli, as well as induce triggers in general. Including those that can slip them into the entranced state, such as the snap of fingers. Their hypnotic depth while entranced does not increase unless exposed to some method of doing so, but additional changes may be made.</li>
    <li><b>At Hypnotic Depth 31-40</b>, you are able to directly, if gradually, alter aspects of a target’s personality, relationships, beliefs, or morals, making them more or less important to them. You may also switch the target of such relationships, making them believe that their beloved is their bitter rival and vice versa. This must be a gradual process. The more important or closely held the thing changed, the more sessions it will take to fully erode or create.</li>
    <li><b>At Hypnotic Depth 41-50</b>, you are able to completely rewrite memories of beliefs, time, relationships wholesale, changing their nature entirely. The ability to entirely add or remove aspects of a person’s psyche still eludes you.</li>
    <li><b>At Hypnotic Depth 50 or higher</b>, the target is fully yours. They are considered Captured, with the funds deposited into your account. You are able to make or unmake aspects of a target’s mind. This is the point of mindbreak and complete personality rewrite. Purchased Companions automatically come at this stage.</li>

Additionally, since Hypnotic Media only change what a person believes to be normal, it cannot compel them to take specific actions. </p>
    <p>Hypnotic Media cannot entrance someone or increase their Hypnotic Depth, but it does treat their breakpoints as one level higher for purely passive behaviors. For example, you might create a piece of Hypnotic Media that causes people to believe it's normal for waitresses to work with their breasts exposed and that they should just ignore it if it doesn't turn them on. This would be able to alter the perception of patrons who have yet to cross any breakpoints, because it does not require them to do anything, but the waitresses would need to have crossed their first break point, if you want them to ignore the fact that their breasts are exposed.</p>
    <p>By default, Hypnotic media may take the form of either video or audio content and may be mixed into or layered on top of normal media, but it must be played by a device running your Hypnosis App. Once no longer exposed to your Hypnotic Media, its effects will gradually fade based on the duration and frequency of exposure.

In addition to the recipes for specific concoctions, you will be able to order up to 5 doses of varying substances at a time. These may be returned or more ordered once they are used, and come in several major categories: Aromatics, Topicals, Ingestibles, and Injectables.</p>
    <p><b>Aromatics</b> are aerosolized chemicals which will increase a target’s Hypnotic Depth by 1 for every hour exposed, and are available in a variety of delivery methods. Frequent favorites include incense sticks, candles, and censers and may come paired with a wide variety of common scents. These may include the inducement towards an emotional state, such as joy, bravery, confidence, desire, lust, or fear.</p>
    <p><b>Topicals</b> are creams, poultices, slimes, soaps, or other viscous fluids or pastes which increase a target’s Hypnotic Depth with direct contact. At a minimum of 5% coverage, topicals will increase the target’s hypnotic depth by 1 every 2 hours, 1 per hour at 10% coverage, and increasing to 5 per hour at full coverage. If the target has reached a Breakpoint and the topical has full body coverage for an hour, the topical will break through by increasing the target’s Hypnotic Depth by 1. Topicals may alter cosmetic traits or have minor physiological effects, such as changing skin or hair color or texture, to alter the sensitivity of skin, cleaning, lubricating, minorly accelerating healing, protecting from UV rays, or similar.</p>
    <p><b>Ingestibles</b> come as a powder which may be consumed in a variety of methods, such as being mixed into a drink or cooked into a meal, or snorted directly. A single ‘dose’ is a line of powder and will increase a target’s Hypnotic Depth by 5. Ingestibles are able to induce specific emotional states as per aerosols, or may instead subtly and gradually alter an ingester’s physiology as per Advanced Runes: Body, such as increasing or reducing breast size or hair length up to a certain point. Partial doses have proportionally lesser effects.</p>
    <p><b>Injectables</b> are drugs which must be directly introduced to tissues or the bloodstream, most commonly via direct injection. A full dose of an injectable will increase a target’s Hypnotic Depth by 10 or, if at a Breakpoint, will break through it by increasing the target’s Hypnotic Depth by 1. In addition to being able to force an absolutely debilitating level of emotional inducement, or significant body alterations, injectables are able to apply a single Hypnotic Depth 31-40 level or lower command or forcibly entrance a target for 1 hour.</p>
    <p>While doses are calibrated for roughly human-sized targets, custom orders for larger or smaller targets may be ordered. Ordering an oversized dose is not recommended, as overdosing on Mind Altering Concoctions risks complete, permanent, irreparable mindbreak scenarios without Warranty Plan.</p>
    <p>Note that targets with the appropriate superhuman senses may be able to detect Mind Altering Concoctions. Additionally, the Contractor is not immune to direct applications of them, exempting Defenses.</p>

    <p>EVE Chips come in two forms, Familiar Chips and Companion Chips. Familiar Chips will cause discomfort and headaches in an individual when thinking or acting against the Contractor’s stated desires, or reward them with appropriate pleasure stimulation. Companion Chips perform similarly, nudging the individual to love and obey the contractor and to consider them in a sexual sense. Additional criteria may be added or removed from a chip when it is not implanted in an individual.</p>

    <p>The Resonance cost of a Ward is equivalent to the Binding cost for the power of targets it will block the passage of:
    3 Resonance will prevent the passage of blue- star targets, but not prevent them from acting across it.
    5 Resonance will prevent the passage of copper-star or lower targets, and prevent blue-star targets from acting across the threshold.
    7 Resonance will prevent the passage of silver-star or lower targets, and prevent copper-star targets from acting across the threshold.
    9 Resonance will prevent the passage of gold-star or lower targets, and prevent silver-star targets from acting across the threshold.
    11 Resonance will prevent the passage of even Imaginary Tier targets, and prevent gold-star targets from acting across the threshold.
    13 Resonance will prevent even Imaginary Tiers from acting across the threshold.</p>
    <p>Wards may be keyed to block only specific things or prioritize avenues of attack of similar breadth to the Defense perks. This requires less Resonance. Wards keyed to prioritize one avenue of attack (such as magic) but still prevent passage cost 1 less Resonance. For example: A ward meant to contain a mystically powerful but physically frail spellcaster could cost 2 or 4 Resonance if their magic is T4-6 or T7-9 respectively. Wards that only prevent an avenue of action across them rather than preventing movement cost 2 less Resonance.</p>

    desc: `<p>These foci are items specially built to empower rituals and magic, enjoy Company protections like your Smart Device once made. They will only add mystic resonance if their acquisition required effort from the Caster and they are actively used in the casting in some way. Destroying or sacrificing the ritual implement, as part of the ritual, increases the resonance granted by it by 2.</p>
    <p>Foci require 5 Resonance and often a significant period of time to attune to, as the only appropriate Arcane Links that may be used must relate to the caster themselves and major experiences they have undergone. Beloved items, handcrafted works, or other things that have deep personal meaning to the caster are often the best options for this. Ways to apply effort to increase the weight of a potential focus include, but are not limited to, consecration of the item, multiple purification rituals, carefully hand-inscribing the phrases or words of the ritual upon the item, or things such as speaking the words of binding over the tallow of the candle as it sets.</p>
    <p>What follows is a list of some of the most common forms of foci and the power they would grant.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Mirrors: things such as polished plates, reflecting pools, or modern mirrors represent sight, soul, and the self. A mirror reduces the cost to apply Arts to yourself, as well as all Arts of Awareness, by 2.</li>
    <li>Coins: Paper money, banker bonds, or even actual coins represent material wealth, construction, repair, and inanimate or intangible things that last beyond human lifespan. A spell may be cast and stored into the focus to be released at a later time. If the focus is consumed upon the release of the spell, the initial casting upon it gets the +2 Resonance bonus of destroying the focus.</li>
    <li>Cups: Often a way to spread a spell among a group, they are not just cups, but also plates, pots, bowls, or urns. They are the way to contain and provide. Cups remove the Resonance cost to apply a spell to multiple targets, provided they all partake of the vessel or are otherwise anointed by it in the ritual.</li>
    <li>Athames: These are knives, blades, tools of carving, cutting, and thought made action. Arcane Links or other things sacrificed as part of a ritual for greater Mystic Resonance provide double the total bonus that they would otherwise.</li>
    <li>Hammers: These are drivers, mallets, or other types of hammers, used to strike at a thing time and again to cause change or to construct and reshape. Every additional casting of the same Art on a subject (successful or otherwise) provides an additional +1 Resonance, up to +3 Resonance.</li>

export const symbioteRules = `
<h3 class="font-semibold text-xl py-4">Symbiote: Eggs</h3>
<p>A set of black eggs appear scattered around your starting location or safehouse: one for each purchased individual in your starting build, or a minimum of five. Each one contains an alien symbiote guided by your mental commands, which will instinctively attack and merge with their targets in a sexual manner. In addition to their basic effects, the default binding tattoos will prevent purchased waifus from lethally harming your symbiote larvae. Waifus captured in other ways will usually accept the symbiote outright if they know you want them to. The first target to fall victim to one of your symbiotes or be transformed by any other symbiote-related binding method will automatically become your queen.</p>
<p>Additional eggs, and thus larvae, come from your queen. First, you must fertilize your queen in the traditional human fashion. If you have Fertility Calibration, you may choose between egg production, live humanoid births - see the Offspring section under Additional Rules - and contraception. Results will be random otherwise. In an all-yuri swarm, a symbiote host’s tail may act as a phallus substitute for this purpose, provided it isn’t the queen’s own tail. Either way, the queen will produce one egg, about the size of an ostrich’s, every two days, for the next four weeks. Symbiote eggs will hatch after two weeks of incubation, depending on ambient temperature: warmer is faster, up to a limit.</p>
<h3 class="font-semibold text-xl py-4">Symbiote: Larvae and Capturing</h3>
<p>By default, symbiote larvae are obligate carnivores and may require up to five days to feed and grow large enough to take hosts. Your first larvae, however, will hatch fully-grown. Larvae are comparable in size and intelligence to a small dog or wild cat, such as a beagle or lynx. Larvae are not truly sapient, living only to merge with a future host. However, they are somewhat intelligent and capable of using tactics and trickery to more effectively attack more dangerous targets.</p>
<p>Larvae are perfectly concealed until they initiate a capture. They cannot be fought off by any target of effective tier (after step 5) 5 or below. When a larva strikes, it will latch onto the target’s back, aligning its spine with hers before penetrating her with its tail and engulfing her head with its own. It pumps a transformative fluid into her from both ends, merging their bodies together into a more idealized, sexual form. The normally-phallic tip of a larva’s tail can invert itself for use against male targets.</p>
<p>Against all targets, this initial transformation causes significant increases in muscle definition, particularly in the arms, abdominals, glutes, and legs. For female targets, it also causes severe non-muscular growth of the breasts, rear and thighs. Against male targets, it instead has a greater effect on muscles, including the pectorals, and adds to penis size and girth. Regardless of gender, the target sizes for any trait are roughly 100% on the scales defined in Advanced Runes: Body, with up to 20% error in any direction. If desired, symbiote masters may subject themselves to the same growth, according to their gender, as their swarm members. This must be manually triggered with the aid of a larva or swarm member. This growth may be re-triggered for any swarm member in the same way, at any time.</p>
<p>This initial growth is not optional, but may recede after the fact at a rate of 3 percentage points every 5 hours. The full extent of this recession, if any, depends on practical concerns and your personal preference.The initial transformation will also induce a surge of lust that will only fade when satisfied by you or another symbiote host whose lust surge has previously been satisfied. Capture credits are rewarded once this lust has faded.</p>
<p>As an alternative, even without any spare larvae, you and your queen may also convert a target in person by transmitting the same transformative fluid from her mouth or tail. This trades speed and immediate effect for subtlety; you or your queen can let your tail out without the rest of the armor, make out or have sex with the conversion target, and then leave before the real transformation begins.</p>`
