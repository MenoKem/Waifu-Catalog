Strictly speaking, the soul gem is only required for its functions as an item (e.g. transforming & detransforming, detecting magic, etc), and she may operate and use her powers without it in a pinch - but her soul gem is as much a part of her magical girl regalia as her magical girl uniform or signature weapon, and she may always recreate it or recall it to herself at will as long as she's alive to do so. Finally, a meguca won't transform into a witch if her soul gem darkens completely (though she is still 'out of' magic while it remains in such a state), and she no longer needs an object such as a grief seed in order to purge that darkness from her gem. This applies to captured witches as well.<p>Just as using magic and falling into despair causes her soul gem to dim, true hope and other deeply felt positive emotions on her part may restore her soul gem's shine. The magic pool in a meguca’s soul gem naturally recovers at a rate of one percent every minute, plus or minus the above effects of positive or negative emotions, respectively. If a gem darkens completely, its magic will not be usable, even if full, until the meguca deeply feels a positive emotion.</p><p>Amano Suzune:  If you have a Puella Magi in your retinue and have taken Salvation, Amano Suzune may (if present) copy their magic after their Doppel fades as if she had slain a Witch. Alternatively, if you have an Adjuster, the Adjuster may, through contact with Suzune's and another meguca's soul gems, overwrite Suzune's copied magic with the magic of the girl in question. (Adjusters themselves are ineligible as copy targets.) By default, any purchased Suzune Amano has her magic pre-set to Tsubaki's fire manipulation magic.</p><p>Other Characters: You may choose whether a purchased Kureha Yuna has her original personality or what she became after her hatred and despair caused her magical girl form to grow an oni horn.</p><p>If you have Isabeau and any binding method, her meguca contractees will be bound as if you had used the Stamp on them.</p><p>If for any reason a member of your retinue is incapable of being communicated with via telepathy, Sudachi's mumbling will instead be perfectly understandable to them.</p><p>You and all members of your retinue can see through Sana's passive invisibility, regardless of whether you have any magical abilities or not.</p><p>Mitama and Momoko can, at will, transform into their summer mermaid version in addition to their normal magical girl transformation, without any need for Mitama to alter their normal magical girl transformation. If you have Mitama, or Momoko and another Adjuster, she can grant any magical girl from the setting the same ability.</p><p>Once in your retinue, Himena will believe you to be her dead boyfriend and can't be convinced otherwise. If you are killed and Himena is still alive, your soul will be tethered to her body.

They can still drown the normal way, but they no longer instantly sink and will keep their powers and strength while submerged or touching sea-stone. Haki is a ki art and is thus affected by Soul Talent. You can only have one Devil Fruit power at a time, unless you do what Blackbeard did or are a networked being with multiple minds and bodies such as highly-developed Transhumans or the Misaka Network - in which case each mind-body can have one power. Additional Devil Fruits after your first, whether through Template Stacking, an actual Devil Fruit, or some other means, will overwrite your current Devil Fruit power. If your previous power was acquired through an actual Devil Fruit, or Warranty Plan activates for you, the fruit will respawn elsewhere in the One Piece universe as normal.",

Summons (non-humanoid): Non-humanoid summons, including Phoenix, Valefor, and Anima, can switch between their humanoid and original forms at will. Anima’s human form can't use Pain or Oblivion, but knows all generic skills/spells from FFX by default. Her Aeon form is mobile, with no chains and a complete lower body. Her original lower half, 'the Shadow,' has its own complete lower body and lives in an explicit pocket universe. Oblivion feeds a target to the Shadow like normal. Anima may also temporarily switch places with her Shadow; this tends to result in extreme collateral damage. Other: White Mage has her 8-Bit Theater characterization. If you have a waifu from FFV, the four Crystals will spawn not too far out of your way, allowing you and your waifus access to the game’s job system. Lenna Tycoon has the wind drake Hiryu as a familiar - likewise for the other two female party members from FFV: Faris Scherwiz and her sea dragon Syldra, and Krile and her own wind drake that has no canon name.
