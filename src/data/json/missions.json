    "desc": "Do you find yourself struggling to find the time for a montage? Or maybe you've grown so strong that conventional methods of training fail to provide any results? If so, then THIS is the mission that you have been waiting for!\n\nShould you accept this mission you will be temporarily transported to Universe 7's Earth sometime between Age 756 and 761, or simply known as the time-skip between Dragonball and Dragonball Z. Earth is at peace, Piccolo has yet to be redeemed, Goku has just settled down with Chichi, and it will be years before the Saiyans arrive to threaten Earth.\n\nYour mission is therefore a simple one: Acquire Earth's Dragonballs through any means you deem fit. In return you will be awarded a copy of the famous Hyperbolic Time Chamber which functionally will act as a pocket dimension independent of any current or future pocket dimensions you may come to possess.\n\nOnce acquired, you will be able to summon the Hyperbolic Time Chamber from any flat surface you so desire. Functionally, the Chamber is an exact copy of the canon Hyperbolic Time Chamber, but limited to an omnilateral 10km^3 surrounding the entrance. At the core of the Chamber is housing with beds, baths and kitchenette that can accommodate two individuals at a time. Because of the potential danger to the contractor's life, the housing area has been made impervious to every kind of damage we at the company can conceivably foresee.\n\nUnlike its canon counterpart, your personal Hyperbolic Time Chamber is limited in its capacity to speed up your relative time. This is due to the sheer energy required to dilate a contractor's local time. By default the Chamber accelerates time by a factor of 2:1, and can maintain these levels for a total of 48 local hours before a mandatory rest period is enacted to allow the Chamber to recharge its reserve power. The total rest period is equal to double the time spent in training within the Chamber. Such that if the User spends the local equivalent of the full 48 hours inside the chamber, then outside the Chamber the User must wait an additional 48 hours of real world time waiting for the Chamber to recharge.\n\nShould the User wish to increase the Chamber's time dilation effect or the length spent in chamber an alternative power source must be provided. The Chamber was made with compatibility in mind, and any conceivable alternative power source is possible, be it a fusion reactor, a sun, an enemy, a retinue member or even from your own reserves. However, this is extremely taxing and the efficiency takes a sharp decline when using alternative power sources. If using an alternative power source, half of the energy used is wasted for each increase of the time dilation effect by a whole number unit, or by every 12 hours that the duration effect is lengthened.\n\nConversely, the gravitational effects are extremely efficient. You may increase the gravity up to 100Gs without any strain on the reserves. Every additional hundred Gs will reduce the duration the Chamber may be used by 10%. Alternative power sources can fuel the gravity effects with only 15% of energy used wasted.\n\nShould the Chamber run out of reserve power, and the alternative power source used lose 95% of their reserves then the User and any of their retinue sharing the Chamber will be ejected back into the real world safely. Note: the \"Real World\" is hereby classified as whichever world the User entered the Chamber from. User May not enter the Chamber from another pocket dimension.\n\nUpon completion of this mission you will be returned to your previous world."

It should have enough legitimacy to subvert the Greater Will but also be functionable enough to not immediately fall apart if you decide to leave.

Mutually abusive relationship with her girlfriend, but was never really presented as a villain so I'll let it pass.  The fourth?  Wendy?  Spent years getting gaslit by her boss so that she'd become the fourth Herrscher, and then went down like a chump.  Compared to her predecessors, she was weak as all get out.\n\nBut that isn't always true.  See, there was another version of this universe, called Gun Girls Z.  Or Honkai 2nd, if you prefer.

It has even shot itself into space just to appear before Kuro, on that world's moon.\n\nAnd it only appears on the Day of Saturday (weirdly specific, but what can you do?) or, as they call it, the Day of Satur. When the customer leaves after having eaten, they are transported to the specific place they first came from, which is very useful, but can cause confusion if the wrong person were to open the door and the right person went through only to end up in the different door.\n\nWhy are we telling you this? Well, you're objective is simple and will allow you to relax from the assumed hardship you've had to endure during your time as a Contractor.\n\nEssentially, you must go into the \"Western Restaurant Nekoya\" from the Other World and be considered it's regular. Yes, that's right. You must go there, spend money, eat your fill, and enjoy yourself. Chat with the other customers and have a good time. Come hungry, leave happy, as the saying goes.\n\nTo be considered a regular, you must come to this Restaurant on seven Saturdays...in a row.\n\nGood luck, Contractor.

Demi-planes we want you to try out.\nHere are the details about your little new 'kingdom'.\nUnlike the normal ones these are alot more porous, expect unwelcomed guests to stumble their way in here, though it's alot harder to get out than it is in. You'd also have alot less control over the goings and doings inside here beyond what you can enforce with you own power or through your companions.\nThe scale is set to a specific 'region'. Wether this is a sprawling megacity, a county in a Kingdom, of if you prefer a more 'quaint' little place, even a place like Sunnyvale California(Yeah, THAT one).\nThis place, also being stuck within the Shadowfell, will start dealing with incoming monsters, undead, the awakening of magic and magical potential within much of the populous, occasional demon/devil/daemon invasions etc, common stuff really.\nMost forms of 'Divine'/Contract Magic(That which comes from devotion to a more powerful being: Clerics, Paladins, Warrior-Priests etc) are stifled, most 'Arcane' magic(That comes from manipulating some form of reality or external energy source: Wizards, Sorcerers etc) becomes more unstable, and 'Inner' powers(Stuff that comes from a person innately, whether spiritual or Psychic: Ki/Chi, Cursed Energy, Psionics etc.) finds itself getting muddled by all the Negative energy. Whatever general power/magic system you have(D&D Magic, Ki, ect) will begin to manifest in this plane, with residents having the potential to develop and hone them.(Essentially treat the common, uncaptured folk of your Domain as having 'Added Potential' for certain 'natural' power systems you possess.)\nAlso, if you already had a pocket apartment/home/mansion/world, it'll either be merged into this plane, though you can keep out the other effects of the Shadowfell from the area around your original home, thought this will only keep out the metaphysical effects, monsters and locals can wander in, so start investing in some home defenses and gates. \nWhile in General the realm will be dark, gloomy and dangerous, they generally follow 'themes'. You won't find mummies rising from the grave in your cyberpunk city nor are werewolf attacks going to be common in a flying city. The 'theme' can be influence by the environment itself, the people as well as the Darklord's Whims. Unless specified or modified via the Home's Control Center, your Home will shift to the 'theme' of your realm."

Soon afterwards, there existed a Dragon who had made a working 'friendship' with another Dragon of the opposing Faction.\n\nTohru and Elma. These two wonderfully powerful Dragons had a falling out and lost that friendship due to one's own desire to feast on the offering made to her.\n\nMany years had passed, but, on a deep level, Elma came to miss her former friend because the food tasted better when they were still around one another. It hurt even more when Tohru had acted cold to her and was serving the human known as Miss Kobayashi.\n\nMany things happened before they were able to reconcile their differences.

They both cared for one another in their own way and now it's time to make those feelings soar to new heights!\n\nAnother thing to note is that is Mission is best taken after you had already Captured Tohru.

Oh, and your hair is now permanently that color, congratulations! We'll let you use characters that have power ups that change their hair color into your choice of color but it has to be more than a one off power up, they must use that power up at least three times and it must consistently change their hair color to the same color. Otherwise it doesn't count.\n\nSo Goku going super saiyan is fine but a anime character briefly having golden blonde hair for a single gag scene is not. Oh and, if they happen to have a split hair color, they count as any and all hair colors they might have. That means Neopolitan/Trivia Vanille can count as pink or brown and Rogue/Anna Marie can be white or brown. \n\nFor those with nonstandard hairs like Ahsoka Tano or an Asari, just use their hair \"tendrils\" color instead. If they are bald like The Ancient One or otherwise without a hair stand in such as any number of energy beings, then they are sadly not allowed. Shapeshifters follow the same rules as power up hair color changes meaning that if they regularly used a hair color, it's allowed. \n\nWe'll let you use basic things that you can learn even without talents like physical fitness and martial arts like MMA and sword fighting since those are just too basic to restrict without it getting too annoying but things like Chakra, Ki, Aura, Magic, and Super Tech? You cannot learn from, power swap to, or template off of someone who doesn't share your chosen color. Period. Oh, and if you already have powers that do not qualify, they'll be disabled until you opt out of this challenge.\n\nNow let's talk pay. You'll get five credits per month until you opt out, if you ever do, an immediate free personal template of or T6 and lower power swap to anyone with your chosen hair color, and the longer you last, the higher the credit payout. If you make it an entire year, it becomes ten credits a month, make it two years and it becomes five credits a week, make it four years and it becomes ten credits a week. It caps out at year five, making two credits every single day for the rest of your time in this challenge. ",

Within the Valkyries, who swore to serve their Queen, was a girl by the name of Ama, sister to her Monarch. She devoted her entire being for her sun, her Monarch, and was her knight.\n\nHowever, it was not meant to be...for the Valkyries questioned Lee's actions in intervening in the Timelines and raised their swords toward their own Queen for they suffered each time they ventured and changed an outcome and lost many sisters along the way. They had forgotten their Oath.\n\nAnd so, a civil war began, with Ama in the thick of it. She tried oh so hard to reason with them and to no avail. She was forced to watch as her beloved Monarch was slain. In a vengeful wrath, she made they pay with their lives and killed them all herself. She spared none of her former sisters even a facet of her mercy and destroyed them, leading to a violent bloodshed. And so, utterly broken, she took Lee's place and became the Monarch herself.\n\nYears passed with her beginning becoming a distant memory. She became a shell of her former self and has watched the many Timelines. Unlike her late sister, who sought to intervene the Timelines for good, Monarch began to use them for her own ends, to protect the balance, for when there is good, there must be evil to rise up and she would become that stronger evil.\n\nAnd so, she produced clones of herself and bent the Timelines to her will and included versions of her in their story, to befriend the protagonists and learn their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nYour Mission will not be simply by any means. In fact, you may even die. You must Capture a clone Monarch has sent in and survive!\n\nEssentially, should you choose to accept, is to appear in a World where a \"reckless protagonist\" is present. This usually means Worlds that are deemed 'Shonen Jump', such as Naruto, Full Metal Alchemist, My Hero Academia, etc.\n\nGood news is that, since the version of Monarch you will be looking to Capture is close with the protagonist, they should be around the same \"Power Level\" based on the World you've selected to appear.\n\nBad news, is that, once you Capture the clone of Monarch and the clone disappears either to your Pocket Apartment or the World you came previously, swarms of versions of Monarch throughout the Multiverse will appear from the sky and down down. They will attack with the intent to kill. Survive!\n\nAnd if you thought that wasn't enough, Monarch herself will appear to erase you from existence for daring to take one of her with you when it looks like you are overwhelming her clones or you successfully managed took take down all of her clones, whether by subduing them or kill them.\n\nHer skill is unrivaled and, considering she's had centuries (assumably) of solidarity, you best prepare yourself to be beaten down with an inch of your life should you choose to fight her.\n\nYou're only option is to last an hour fighting and/or from her or quell her anger, and even that will be tough as she stewed in those emotions for a very, very long time.\n\nRecommend getting Trace Defense, Paradox Defense, Fatality Defense, and Destiny Defense at max level as she has mentioned to be able to literally reset a Timeline.\n\nGood luck.

Well don't worry cuz if your smart you won't have to, you 'see these are the rules.\n\nFrom the moment you arrive on your starting world 33 pieces of a replica millennium puzzle will be spread across it and all you have to do to stop bill is to collect all 33 pieces and reassemble the puzzle, but to make things more interesting all pieces will be sent to either dangerous places or well hidden area's and are equipped with one level of Trace Defence and two levels of Paradox Defence, which will make finding them hard but not impossible.\n\nOh and you have 3 years to find them all or he gets free, Goodluck."

Change this fate! (No pun intended)\n\nSimply put, make Touko take her originally assumed path and have her obtain that which her sister already had in Canon. After all, wouldn't it be so very frustrating to be promised something, only to have it denied and given away and be unable to do a single thing about it? I mean, it even brought her to tears and made her fester a deep-seated hatred for quite awhile.\n\nObviously, there two ways to go about this: Substitute as Touko herself and make that happen your own hands or come in and tell her honestly yourself.\n\nIt's recommended to obtain Fatality Defense, Trace Defense, and Paradox Defense as the path to the Root, no matter how prepared it may be, has a chance of erasing Touko from existence should she accidentally touch one of the obstacles towards the Root itself. As for Trace Defense, it is so the Red Shadow (assumed to be a Counter Guardian) does not perceive the first usage of True Magic and seek to eliminate her.\n\nGood luck, you're gonna need it~"

It essentially grants anyone endowed with the Falna boosted Stats if they were a Level higher than they currently were.\n\nA related item that must be protected for this Mission is an item that, while dark in nature and horribly heretical, can trap the Renard's Youjutsu and Soul and spread it to others by a certain sacrificial ritual, also known as the Killing Stone.\n\nHowever, because of the actions of a frustrated Aisha Belka, the plan was significantly delayed and later stopped by the Hestia and Freya Familia, both for differing reasons.\n\nYou will have two routes you can be brought in, before Aisha destroys the first Killing Stone the Ishtar Familia originally had or sometime before the day of Ishtar Familia's Canon disbanding.\n\nIt's simple, allow the Killing Stone Ritual to transpire successfully, trapping the soul of Sanjouno Haruhime into the Killing Stone on the Night of the Full Moon before breaking it to be used for the Ishtar Familia in their war with the Freya Familia.\n\nGood luck!",

Well, the setting of Asura's Wrath has an unending horde of monsters attacking their civilization too, and they're called the Gohma.  You see, the local civilization has been destroying souls to extract Mantra, the accumulated energy of humans' religious faith.  But since this is removing souls from the cycle of reincarnation, Gaea's gotten angry, and has started turning normal animals into monsters, so that the Gohma will return the souls of the humans they kill to the cycle, along with any accumulated Mantra.\n\nNaturally, there are Company personnel that want to experiment on the Gohma to see if they can get anything out of the buggers, so if you're willing to brave this DR10 setting, where even the most minor Gohma have the body temperature of magma and the planet itself is genocidal to humanity, you'll be rewarded handsomely - just for starters, we'll give you a copy of Drain Defense after your first successful capture to mitigate that whole soul-stealing business, and the point rewards are equal to 50% of the capture-plus-sale Tier value of the Gohma at Intensity 10.\n\nWe will give you a conditional upgrade to your chosen Binding method; it will become vastly more effective against Gohma, but any Gohma captured using the enhanced Binding will be auto-sold, giving zero points, but incrementing the capture counters for this mission.  Capturing Gohma with your regular binding will give points according to the Company's 'generic captures' rule, but will NOT increment this mission's capture counters.  The enhanced Binding will not work on human-type enemies; we're only interested in Gohma.\n\nIf you do not have Information and Trace Immunities, we will provide you with a specialized version of those Defenses, calibrated to make sure Gaia and the TX Chakravartin don't notice the permanent loss of Mantra energy caused by captures made with the enhanced Binding.  This does not apply to captures made with your regular Binding.  WARNING: this specialized Defense is not sufficient to keep Chakravartin from noticing a capture of a single-headed Gohma Vlitra; you will need the actual Defense perks.  WARNING: even with a full suite of Defenses, Chakravartin will still notice if you capture the Vlitra Core via any method - the thing is too plot relevant for such an event to go ignored.\n\nMost of the additional objectives are repeatable to some extent.  Unless explicitly stated otherwise, each additional objective pays out once for every thousand Gohma of that type, after paying out on the first, tenth, and hundredth captures of that type of Gohma.\n\nI warn you again, this setting is DR10.  Be prepared for soul-eating monsters and magma-hot projectile attacks.",

    "desc": "This one is going to be tough, I hope you can handle it, for her sake. After seeing a number of missions about parenting various girls, and one pretty boy, who would normally get screwed over in that category, I decided it was time for another. Specifically, Mordred Pendragon from the Nasuverse. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to kidnap and raise Mordred Pendragon from a young age all the way to adulthood. Yes, adulthood which Mordred never actually made it to in canon, hell she didn't even make it to double digits chronologically.\n\nThat's not all of course, there's three main things I want you to do, I want you to make her actually happy, ensure that she confidently walks around as a female warrior, and that she fulfills her immense potential. While she is, to put it bluntly, an inferior copy of her father in canon, she only had at most seven years to properly train even with accelerated aging and still reached such amazing heights despite everything. If she actually made to eighteen years old chronologically, I don't see why she couldn't surpass her father.\n\nThis does mean that you'll need to deal with Morgan, the world, and destiny itself trying to force your new daughter to fulfill her destiny as the knight of betrayal while Artoria will be on edge due to Mordred sharing her face. You will need to at least delay Mordred dealing with that whole mess until she's eighteen. Then, if she feels like it, she's free to do whatever she wants even if that happens to be burning down camelot and killing king Artoria, then so be it. but she damn well better be an actual adult this go around and not some poor kid being emotionally manipulated by her own mother into killing her neglectful and emotionally distant father.\n\nMordred will gain the standard framework for early captures once you \"take custody\" of her but well, her canon equipment is in the hands of Artoria and Morgan... So good luck with that. Oh, and while you sticking around is preferred, there's nothing stopping you from taking Mordred and running off to a different world if you don't like the idea of sticking around. Everlasting will prevent Mordred from aging too far and body tune up can be used to turn off her accelerated aging if desired while also taking care of any minute imperfections that could come with her atypical manner of birth."

Nah, this is real life son, why would I downgrade from realistic injury mechanics to a simple HP pool. You'll still heal completely and lose any debuffs by sleeping in a bed, but you don't have HP, and instead of MP, you simply have a gauge that reflects the energy type your new powers require, and cooldowns on single use powers are reflected as status debuffs. Gamer's mind is obsolete if you have company defences. Don't try and skimp on your company dues.\nAs a final benefit, if you take Added Potential in a subject, you can now learn that ability as a skill if taught by someone proficient in it, or by performing the action until the skill appears in your skill list.\nTemplates will immediately grant the skill at Level 1, and you will gain +100% progress towards levelling that skill until you reach the highest tier of the template. Templates with a variety of skills will all begin at Level 1.\nPower Swap's will be treated like Templates, with the skills appearing immediately after purchase, but will be locked for the period of a week as they automatically grind themselves to the tier of the Power Swap target. This doesn't collect data for me, and so I'll incentivise you not to use it.\n\nSo go out and enjoy the great game that is Life!",

Prevent their destruction and cause chaos on the galaxy!\n\nYou will be dropping into the Supply Ship Ahsoka, Barriss, and the clones assigned to them or just before then from when the first clone was infected.\n\nIt is recommended to purchase two levels of Possession Defense for this particular Mission as there is the likelihood of a Brain Worm slipping past your nostril and completely controlling your actions...unless you're into that kinda thing, but you'll be leaving events up to chance should that transpire.\nShould you wish for partial control over your own body while having a slithering partner on your side, simply buy only one level of Possession Defense. This will appease the other infected clones while you still have a worm making their objectives known to you. A win-win for both parties, if you would.\n\nBetter watch out as Ahsoka Tano and Barriss Offee will attempt to stop you and the clones as they justifiably would.\n\nGo forth and spread the influence of the hive and spread Chaos throughout the Galaxy!",

A demigod, by every definition of the word.\nTo be a dragon is to conquer, to rule, to covet. To be a dragonborn is to take all that a dragon is for yourself and grow mightier for it.\nThe world of Skyrim holds many dragons, but only a few were unique. Only a few were named. Take their power for yourself, and rise from mortality to godhood.\nCapture One Unique Named Dragon",

First of all, I would like you to understand that what I am about to say is classified government information.\n\nThe Earth is threatened by a powerful creature, who destroyed 70% of the Moon with its power, and within a year the Earth will also be destroyed. He is a super creature possessing enough power to transform a full moon into a crescent and his maximum speed is mach 20. In other words, if this guy were too seriously run away or fight back, we would be helpless until the day of our destruction. However at the start of the Japanese school year, he will become the homeroom teacher for kunugigaoka junior high school, class 3-E.\n\nThe reason for the earths destruction is not because this creature is some sort of bio weapon, or evil mastermind. Rather it is because he himself is a living Antimatter bomb. Granted, the chance of explosion is less than one percent, however even this chance is too high. Thus the world's leaders are exerting considerable effort to kill him behind the scenes, before the world is plunged into panic.\n\nThis is why we have contracted you. \n\nNow, cutting straight to the point. Your mission is simple:\n\nYour job is to assassinate Korosensei within one year, before anyone else can, or else he'll blow up the Earth. \nOr you can save Korosensei, by removing that last one percent chance, and by assisting him when he faces off against his former apprentice at end of the school year. \n\nWhile daunting, there are several ways to accomplish this mission. Especially with your own brand of out of context involvement. \n\nSave or kill Korosensei, rewards are dependent on which choice you take.\n\n\nKill Reward: The equivalent of 10 billion yen (or 30 billion yen if you were in a group assassination) in whatever currency you want, the title “God of Death” that will also follow you to future worlds (toggleable).\nSave Reward: Automatic capture of Korosensei, one free Added Potential (Antimatter Tentacles) with little to no drawbacks for you or one of your retinue.",

Instead of getting [Mind Defense], he set up the magical means of his [Template] to defend agaist such dangers; however, he did not take into account that mental hazards in Dead Space are psychic in nature, and thus are able to bypass magical defenses easily.\n\nSo, during his mission, he got imprinted with Marker data.\n\nAfter completing his task over there, the Contractor went back to his starter world where he had the primary base of operations set up. The mental contagion progressed until the point he started building the Red Markers - we do not know how he justified that to himself as he was aware of the end result of their construction. The events continued as you could expect them to: Necromorphs started rising in main cities across the planet, and with the world having their own form of magic, the creatures spawned also possessed the similar abilities alongside notable resistance to thaumaturgical influences.\n\nEventually the Contractor triggered the Convergence. The Brethren Moon was born.\n\nNow, usually the Moons are not a problem for the Company, as we actually harvest them for materials all the time - for example, the Biomorph line of Transhuman Heritage relies heavily on the stuff. But here things got complicated by inclusion of thaumaturgically active species into its biomass, and then got even more complicated by the absorbtion of active Contractor and his retinue - all their abilities from Heritage and Templates also got copied and massively empowered. Even worse is that the Moon got his knowledge, and that his Template had the capabilities of multiversal travel; using that, it managed to crack interdimensional portals and jumped to another world. That was the point in time we had detected it.\n\nWhile we could not care less about that world dying - after all, countless number of them are being destroyed every second - letting out the Moon onto the wider Multiverse is... undesirable. Thus we are issuing the emergency mission for available Contractors and assembling the kill squad.\n\nMake no mistake: this task is going to be hard. If you die, you will only fuel the Moon, expanding its abilites even more - so if you do not possess at least T8 level of power, do not attempt to join on this mission.\n\nAnd good luck. You'll need it.",

Of course, this mission does offer some basic benefits and overachievers will be given extra points depending on their performance.\n\n-[Body Tune-Up] will be granted for free for this mission.\n\n-The individual will be allowed to choose five credits worth of companions to help in accomplishing their mission, any credits that remain unused will be added to the end reward.\n\n-Both the Individual and companions taking the test will know each other's languages fluently.\n\nThe bare minimum requirement of this mission will be to survive five company quotas but surviving extra will unlock additional rewards. Should the Contractor survive the first five Quota's a button will appear on the ship that will allow the Contractor to finish the mission however they may choose to stay for longer and fight for additional rewards.\n\nOptional Challenges - These are optional modifiers that a potential contractor can take for further rewards, the company loves entertainment after all. A contractor may only take one modifier for this mission.\n\nMemory Loss (2X End Reward Credits Bonus)- The contractor will completely forget about the existence of \"The Company\" and will have no idea why they are there for the duration of this mission, they will still remember that their goal is to survive five quotas from the \"Lethal Company\" and they will be reminded of the existence of bonus awards should they stay but they won't be too sure what exactly those rewards are.\n\nPermanent Memory Loss (4X End Reward Credits Bonus)- The contractor will completely forget about the existence of \"The Company\" and will have no idea why they are there permanently, they will still remember that their goal is to survive five quotas from the \"Lethal Company\" and they will be reminded of the existence of bonus awards should they stay but they won't be too sure what exactly those rewards are.\n\nIs This A CYOA? (6X End Credit Reward Bonus)- In addition to the effects of the Permanent Memory Loss modifier the contractor will not be given their company device or bindings (if any binding was purchased it will be refunded) after this mission is over, any points earned will be spent on their build by either \"The Company's\" agents or an AI simulating what purchases the contractor would potentially make.

A woman who only sought happiness for a girl she considered her sister, and a naive but kind-hearted girl who only sought to help others and be happy with her family. Betrayed by the person they decided to help, both were involved in a situation impossible to solve by themselves that culminated with Rita transforming into a Demon-Type C.O. and dooming her “sister,” Dash, to the same fate with her own hands.\n\nIn the end, Fenrir Squad with the help of ALT Squad managed to end their lives. And thanks to the Administrator's help, Rita and Dash were able to meet one last time before saying goodbye forever.\n\nWell, it's time to change that ending.\n\nYour mission is to avoid the tragic fate of Rita and Dash. The moment you start the mission will be one hour before Rita turns into the Demon-Type C.O. known as Ministra for the first time. Or you can start in the first chapter of the story, an hour before Yoo Mina kills Dash who at that time had already been turned by Ministra into the Demon-Type C.O. known as Spira.\n\nKeep in mind that if Rita and Dash have already been converted into C.O.s then you will need to bind them to you by using one of the bindings provided by The Company, when the binding is completed they will both return to their human form. But without the necessary defenses or Eternium they can still be converted into C.Os. if they spend too much time in the Counter: Side. Also keep in mind that you will begin the mission inside the Counter:Side, without a Counter Template or the necessary defenses, if you spend a lot of time there or decide to venture deeper into the Counter: Side you may become a C.O."

The bad news is due to his abrupt entry he has scrambled the local space to make all forms of teleportation and space control useless; also thanks to his storm divinity running wild the skies have been turned into a hellish gale, shredding anything above a certain height to a fine mist and his divinity of the sky is stopping any attempts at flight, so the only way you will be able to get to him is by sailing there. \n\nGood luck, oh and p.s. try not to go too deep in to the sea, who knows what abominations lurk in the Deep  "

This challenge will be available only at Chargen, for reason that will soon be obvious, now let's dive into the juicy details!\n\nAfter taking on this Mission/Challenge you will have to follow the following steps:\n\n-Create a list of worlds of your choice and assign to each a number from 1 to 9, then roll a die, the number of the die will determine wich world you'll go to, you will receive a 15% bonus to the world budget.\n\n-Take the Great Old One as your patron, you won't be subject to the nightmares, and you won't attract outsiders, for the duration of the mission.\n\n-Take Power Swap, the chosen character must be of the Outsider archetype, and it's tier can't be higher than the tier of your world, you will have a discount that will depend on your world tier and your intensity value, take the two values and subtract the lowest from the highest, the result will be the tier cost you will have to pay for the swap, for example with a tier 9 world and intensity 5, 9-5=4 you will pay the price of a tier 4 for the swap, the cost can't be lower than 10 credits.\n\n-Open the Gacha app, set the tag Outsider and activate \"ignore chances\" and set the cost to 0, now roll untill you have 10 outsiders, there must be at least one with the same tier as your world or higher by one, in case you have already 10 Outsiders but none fulfills this this condition, eliminate the one with the lowest tier and reroll till the condition is fulfilled. These 10 Outsiders will come to your world one after the other within a span of 2 years, will they be enemies? allies? only one way to find out.\n\n-You won't be able to buy any companions during chargen or while the mission is active, but you will receive a companion to help you start, how? You will be able to make a single roll in the Gacha app you can set \"Ignore Chances\" active and you can set up to 3 tags, but the tier of the received companion can't surpass your world tier, in case it does, it's power will be restricted so that it's tier will be equal to your worlds, with training and time this restriction will weaken and disappear.\n\nAfter taking the above mentioned steps you'll be set to complete your build as you wish, but it should be mentioned that there will be some peculiarities you will be subject to, those being the following:\n\n-You won't be an Outsider like most, you'll be something more, an eldritch God, of the likes of Cthulhu and Nyarlathotep to name a few (not in appearance of course), what does that mean? Many things, only those necessary for this mission will be revealed, the rest is for you to discover.\n\n-Faith gives you power, the more prayers to you the greater the power you receive, build grand cults in your name, convert entire worlds, make your words their only reality, the choice is yours.\n\n-You possess the ability \"Eldritch Corruption\" you are able to bind beings to you through your power, you can \"Infect\" the mind of a being with your essence, this will cause them to be slowly corrupted, their mind bending to your will, and binding them to you, this will result in capture, the time needed for this corruption to be complete will depend on the target relative strength to yours, the default time is 10 days, this time is halved for targets with a tier below yours, the greater the difference in tier the more times the time will be halved, for example if you are 4 tiers ahead of the target the time will be halved 4 times, in case the target is of higher tier than the contractor, the time will instead double for each tier of difference.\n\n-Beware that binding a target with one of the standard binding methods won't result in capture anymore, all other effects provided will still work as expected.\n\n-Bound \"Outsiders\" will form your \"Court\", you'll receive part of the faith they receive from their followers, this court will work as an anchor for your existence, as long as there is one member of your court alive, you may not die, the destruction of your body and soul will simply result in your respawn in a safe area under your controll.\n\nNow that is all contractor, are you ready?"

With origins unknown to both heroes and villains, this formidable adversary possesses unimaginable power and a dark influence that corrupts everything in its vicinity. The Abyssal Sovereign's emergence threatens to plunge the world into chaos, testing the limits of both heroes and villains alike.\n\nThough we have managed to gather information on his powers and they are as followed.\n\nDark Energy Manipulation:\n\nThe Abyssal Sovereign can manipulate dark energy, granting it control over shadows, darkness, and negative emotions. This allows the entity to create powerful constructs, absorb energy, and cast devastating attacks.\n\nReality Warping:\n\nThe Abyssal Sovereign has the ability to warp reality within its immediate surroundings. It can create nightmarish landscapes, distort perceptions, and manipulate time and space to its advantage.\n\nCorruption Aura:\n\nAn aura surrounds the Abyssal Sovereign, corrupting everything in its path. Heroes and villains alike are susceptible to the dark influence, causing them to question their alliances and potentially turn against each other.\n\nImmortality:\n\nThe Abyssal Sovereign is effectively immortal, making it impervious to conventional attacks. Its physical form can be shattered, but it will reform, making defeating it a nearly impossible task.\n\nMind Domination:\n\nThe Abyssal Sovereign can invade and dominate the minds of individuals, turning them into mind-controlled minions. This power poses a significant threat to hero society as even the most powerful heroes can be turned against their own kind.\n\nWorldquake:\n\nThe Abyssal Sovereign can trigger seismic events, causing catastrophic earthquakes on a global scale. These earthquakes not only bring physical destruction but also open rifts between dimensions, allowing dark entities to spill into the world.\n\nAlthough he may seem invincible he does have a weakness, and that weakness is the reason he was resting in the earths core to begin with, basically his powers require immense amounts of energy to operate and his body doesn't naturally regenerate the energy he uses so the more you force him to use the less he will have to work with, due to this you must whittle him down till he is weak enough for you to finish him off. \n\nThough it is unlikely you can accomplish this alone, this is because The Abyssal Sovereign presents a challenge that transcends the hero-villain dynamic, requiring an unprecedented level of cooperation among the world's most powerful individuals. Heroes and villains must put aside their differences and work together to confront this cosmic threat, as failure to do so could lead to the irreversible corruption of the world. The fate of humanity rests on the shoulders of those brave enough to face the Abyssal Sovereign. Goodluck\n\n ",

By force.\nThe mission is simple but you need some preparation beforehand.\nYou need to eat 10 of Sukuna's fingers or the people who ate the fingers.(It works the same if you eat only a part of the person where Sukuna concentrated his being using his technique learned from Kenjaku)\n*The condition of this mission is that you need to buy the two levels of Possession Defense.\nWith this, Sukuna can't take over your body, only if you allow it. You will be an even better vessel than Yuji Itadori. Not even feeding you the 20 fingers in a second will make you lose control of your body.\nNow the most tricky part:\n*Defeat Sukuna\nWhen you eat at least 10 fingers, you will be capable at any time of forcing Sukuna into a Ritual. A battle.\nYou two will fight in this mindscape and if you win he will die for real, while you will keep all the spoils.\n*Word Of Caution*\nBe warned that a 10-finger Sukuna is stronger than Jogo. So you need to be on the top of the verse to win, and if you lose Sukuna will have total control over your body and even become a contractor of the company. In the start of the ritual he will be warned of the conditions.\nAnd it would be for the best of you to start the ritual when you ate only 10 fingers for obvious reasons.\nAfter you get rid of Sukuna, you can eat the rest of the fingers without a problem. It will be like you're recovering your own strength."

There are plenty of messed up things out there, and of course there are many contractors that are completely uncaring of all this, what about you? want to have some fun and be a pillar of goodness (or well at least in appearance)? , an agent of divine will and judgement, that is what you shall become, an Angel ready to build his own Heavenly Host.\n\nNow Let's talk about requirements:\n|Only avaible at Chargen|\n|The only Patrons you may have are \"First Contractor\", \"Death\", \"Archangel of Benevolence\"|\n|You must have the heritage perk \"The Unquiet Grave\" or \"Baby Take My Hand\"|\n|You must have the heritage perk \"Harbinger of Deаth\"|\n|Must choose a world that has Demons at Chargen|\n\nAs for the objective of this mission, you must create an heaven and fill it with deserving souls, and build a mighty host of Angels to watch over your realm and spread your influence to multiple worlds.\n\nUpon accepting this mission you shall receive the following:\n\n-Divine will and power shall be bestown upon you, (take the apperance of an angel customization is up to you) making you a being that exists beyond the mortals and their realms, no being classifiable as \"Mortal\" may harm you or any of your Heavenly host, this of course also applies to their creations, but even the Divine has it's weaknesses, in your case Demons or related beings, they will be you greatest nemesis and will be capable of harming you normally and kill you, beware that even a powerfull God/Divine being may kill you, but at the same time no matter if they are Gods Demons or Mortals or their degree of immortallity, a fatal strike from you will bring them a final death.\n\n-You and any other Angel of your host will have the ability to hide your angelic appearance and appear as race of your choice, of course this won't grant you any of said race abilities.\n\n-If you had the perk \"The Unquiet Grave\" before accepting this mission, the range of any totem you will make will cover an entire planet, the afterlife that you may build with this perk must always appear as heavenly, basically it must look like a really nice place to spend eternity in, and of course no soul can be tortured there, while you are in this afterlife you will passively learn any usefull skill or information any soul may possess.\n\n-Only good souls may reside in your afterlife, it will stend to you to define what defines \"Good\", maybe you can stretch the definition a bit and allow somene like the punisher in, but never someone like the joker, so where do the Evil souls go?T his souls may reside in some corner of the realm in a state of torpor till you decide what exactly to do with them, but they may not reside in your afterlife for long or they will be erased.\n\n-If you had the perk \"Baby Take My Hand\" before accepting this mission, you will now have a sixth sense telling you when someone imortant usefull or with potential is dying, and give you the ability to appear at their side instantly from there the perk will continue to work as for standard procedure. Any being turned Psychopomp through this perk will always take an angelic appearance.\n\n-Gain the ability \"Evil Slayer\", now whenever you end the life or unlife of an Evil being all his power will be purified and added to yours, but this dosen't grant you mastery over any new ability you may gain, it won't be any weaker than the original but you must train in it's use if you want to use it as efficiently as it's previous user. In addition if the being you killed is also a demon or demonically corrupted, your gains will be doubled and you will become slightly more resistent to the same type of being you killed.\n\n-Gain the Lure \"Devout Faithfull\" all being that belive in a religion will look at you as a divine incarnation of their God/s, the longer the exposure to your presence the more their reverence and respect for you and your will, you will also be able to switch the effect of this lure to produce effect of love and infatuation for specific targets.\n\n-While you are in your \"Harbinger Form\" if you are fighting \"Evil\" beings you tier is rised by 1 till the end of the fight, additionally your \"Harbinger Weapons\" ignore any defense this evil beings may possess, upon first activation of this form receive a weapon of your choice.\n\n-When a member of the Heavenly host dies they will reappear in your Heaven they won't be able to leave, but will return to \"Life\" an be free to leave after a number of days equal to double their tier.\n\n-Lastly you now emit a Godly aura that scales in power and range with your tier, it can be toggled on and off, it's effects changes with your intention, want peoples groveling at your feets in adoration, or feel hopefull and at peace, you can do it."

No? well whatever, now you have the chance to make it more than an intrusive thought, you're welcome!\n\nFirst of all to accept this mission you must satisfy the following conditions:\n|Have the heritage perks \"Death Mask\" & \"Your Soul Is Mine\"|\n|Have the Binding method \"Tantric Arts\" & \"Art of Summoning\"|\n|Have the perks \"Signed and Sealed\" & \"Letter of the Law\"|\n\nGot them all? Good! Then it's time for juicy details, you may be asking yourself what exactly this mission entails, well pretty simple, not really, anyway let's start:\n\n-Your Psychopomp appearance gained through the perk \"Death Mask\" will become that of a demon, you may customize it as you wish but it must have at least 3 demonic features, like horns wings or a tail.\n\n-You shall receive the perk \"The Unquiet Grave\" for free, but things will be a bit different, you will start with a plane where you as the ruler of hell reside, under this plane there will be 7 more, one for each capital sin, the size of your plane will be the sum of the size of the other 7, the size of this 7 planes of sin will depend on the amount of souls they house, 1 soul equals 1 meter added to the plane radius, but they will all start at 10 square kilometers.\n\n-As \"The\" devil you can't just waltz in a world like any other day! you won't be able to leave your hell, unless you are summoned into a world from someone already on said world. If you accepted this mission at Chargen you won't start in your chosen world, and will have to access it through \"Demonic Grimoire\" if you are able to, to compensate for the loss have a 20% increase to your Chargen budget.\n\n-How do you get summoned? You will be given the ability \"Demonic Grimoire\" you will be able once a day to create a Grimoire and send it to a world of your choice, this book will have a similar ability to \"Jewels of Discord\" as it will steadly increase the urge to be opened and used, it will subtly pull a target to it’s first location, and with time induce them to try and summon \"something\", the target will rationalize it as \"It's fake anyway\", this will result of course in you being summoned. Targets 2 tiers above you will be immune to the Grimoire effects.\n\n-Got summoned what then? The target that has summoned you will be instantly bound and will work as an anchor for you to that world, if he/she dies in a permanent way he/she will directly appear in your hell, and you will be forced out of the world. As long as he/she remains alive you are able to roam the world freely. If you wish to leave a world and return at a later date, you can perform in said world a special tantric ritual that will cost 10 Resonance, you will be able to create a permanent portal between Hell and the world that you can toggle on and off whenever you want.\n-What about contracts? you'll gain the ability \"Deal With The Devil\" in basic words you are able to make verbal or written deals with anyone, but they will always be interpreted in the most advantageous way for you, plus these contracts have the power to alter reality itself to make the deal come true and dosen't depend on your power, basically a wish granting deal.\n\n-The souls empower you, the more souls in your hell the more powerful you are, everything from talents, lures, templates and world acquired abilities are rendered more powerful by the number of souls you possess. Starting from 10 souls your powers will be doubled then for each additional zero to the number of souls the multiplier will double. Every 7 million souls you will gain one tier.\n\n-You must choose one of the 7 sins as your own, you'll become a physical representation of that sin, beings one Tier or more below yours, in your presence will easly and rapidly start to feel influenced by your sin, for example for Greed they may try to get their hands on anything of value in sight, or for Lust they'll become a dog in heat, you may choose to toggle this effect on and off. You can also direct this influence to someone in particular greatly enhancing it's effects and easly bending them to you will. Lastly after choosing your sin you'll be able to create a custom power of your choice that embodies the choosen sin, for example for Greed it may be the ability to become stronger the more treasures you possess, or for gluttony the ability to eat energy based attacks, the only limit is that it must be easly connected to the sin, the Tier of this power will always be equal to your Tier.\n\nFun part is over! Now it's time to see what is required of you to complete the mission:\n|Accumulate a total of One Million souls in each of your 7 planes of sin|\n|Have at least 1 tier 8 being to oversee each of the 7 planes|\n|Connect Hell to 10 different world through permanent portals|\n|Make 1000 deals through \"Deal With The Devil\"|\n|Capture 10 good and 10 Evil Targets|\n|Have 10 cults in your name|"

Normally it would be weaponized depression thanks to Darksied's obsession with the Anti Life Equation, but this time he seems to have kicked in the door to Mt Olympus and stolen some things, because he appears to be using the River Lethe to weaponize horniness and Bimbofy the earth.  Now, strictly speaking, this is a heavy variant universe because Darksied generally doesn't appear to have a sex drive, but you ought to know we really don't care about that and are happy to take advantage of the earths abrupt lack of defenders, even if it does put us - or rather, you - on something of a timer.\n\nRegardless, the briefing.  Darksied has used his stolen power to drop the iq of every woman on earth by a significant number, and turned an unfortunate number of men into women - with lowered iq, naturally - as well.  Amongst others, this means the man of steel will not be available to help save the day. Now, as to the remaining men among the heroes, well, they've been infected with a fragment of lust altered Anti Life.  Lets just call it the Lust Equation for now.  As such, they're somewhere between wild beasts, and smaller Darksieds.  Darksied himself has retreated to Apokalips to refine Power Girl into one of his furies, and will be returning once the infected men dominate a significant portion of the empowered population.\n\nBy our estimation, this will take no more than a week, and will only take that long because the infected men are going to be more distracted by doing their utmost to ruin any woman within their grasp than they are with specifically seeking out more women to infect.  In the meantime, well, anyone not already claimed is effectively free real estate.  Go in, stamp as many people as you can, and get back out.  You're free to keep as many of these sluts as you want, but do be aware that the vast majority of them are now crippled as heroes.  Or villains, if that's your style.",

But this also has the side effect of some stronger quirked zombies damaging themselves.\n\nOk enough messing around here is your mission. Kill all of the zombies, stop further infection and re-establish some form of society. Good luck and BTW a few zombies landed in the USJ have fun.   "

You may still capture waifus and husbandos like normal. You cannot bind opponents, and force them to throw a Pokémon battle. \n\nAll regions you are not currently in will be time locked while you are undertaking the mission. Don't worry we will keep Arceus from seeing this. Don't worry about bugs. We have a quality assurance department unlike Game Freak.\n \nYou must complete the objectives of the game, manga, or anime season.  \nExample: (Pokémon Red) Become champion of Kanto region and defeat Team Rocket. \nExample: (Anime Season 1) Compete in the Pokémon League Tournament\n\nAfter completion you will be given the option to move to the next region or season of the anime. You can choose to stick around and catch more Pokémon or do post game activities until you are ready to proceed or end the mission early. Post game includes challenging the gym leaders again with there A team. Additional rewards will be given for defeating all gym leaders A team in a region. \n\nYou cannot return to a region until you have chosen to end the mission. You can end the current region you are in prematurely if you find you cannot complete it, and start a new one. All mission progress will be lost in the region you abandon. Abandoning the Anime will result in being locked out of later seasons. Once the mission ends you can choose to be dropped into an alternate timeline, and you will revert to your normal age. \n\nCompleting the Pokédex is not required, but will grant bonus rewards. You will be given the opportunity to catch each Legendary Pokémon in a region once including event and mythic Pokémon. A Pokémon can still be captured if they faint, but most will try to run if they are severely injured. \n\nYou do not need to have every evolution of a Pokémon to count as Pokédex complete. As long as you had that form at some point. \nExample: Catch Grimer evolve it into Muk\n\nYou can trade with other contractors if you have a green orb. You will find a GTS app installed on your company phone. \nIn all regions that have Pokémon that need to be traded to evolve you will find someone willing to trade the same Pokémon to get an evolved form.  \n\nGood luck on your Pokémon Journey.

In any event, the series tagline was 'gotta catch em all', and that's just what I want you to do.   Play a game of Pokemon using Mamano, or something close enough to it.\n\nFor the most part, this will mean convincing Mamano and their incubus husbands to compete with you in various things in place of having a Pokemon battle.  Maybe yours and his Mamano wives can compete for who can make the best homecooked meal, who can suck cock without air for the longest, or who can convince an ordinary woman to hook up with her crush the fastest/with minimal use of Mamano Energy.  Of course, all that is just a stand in for random trainers.  I'd also like something to represent gym battles, the mandatory criminal organization, maybe even the champion fight.  That'll probably require going up against the Demon Lord and her husband though, so good luck with that.  \n\nThis mission is considered over after completing five of the eight objectives, but you can come back to the remaining three at any given time - consider it the equivalent to postgame content."

However, instead of appearing inside Singularity F like she normally would, she will meet face-to-face with you, dear contractor. Where this takes place is entirely up to you. It could be in a black void, or it could be in a comfy room in your Demiplane, we don't care. What we do care about is what happens next.\n\nYou will offer yourself to her. In other words, you will be making Olga a Demi-Servant with YOU as a base, and you will become nothing more than a voice in her head. As nothing more than a spirit, you will NOT be able to interact with the world in any way except in a few circumstances. Do note that as a Magus, she is inherently sceptical about deals coming from unknown entities, so there is a chance she will not take the deal. However, explaining her circumstances should do the trick and get her to accept. Once she does, The Company will take care of the rest. \n\nOnce Olga accepts the deal, she will have access to your powers and skillset, barring contact with the Company. You may restrict what access she has to your skillset as you please. Talents, Lures and Defences will still work, unless, again, you restrict them.  \n\nOlga will immediately become whatever Tier you were before the merger, with a maximum of T6. With enough training and time to adapt, this limit can be increased to T7.\n\nFinally, as much as certain advice could be useful in certain situations, sometimes it's not enough. During this mission, THREE TIMES and three times only will we allow you to forcefully take control of Olga's body, allowing you to regain your full power. There will be a time limit of 1 minute for each instance, so use them wisely. "

Oh, and before I forget No Mind Control, No Bindings, and Lures only work a fraction the amount they should. If you can win without exposing your powers or even using them to play the game fair and square, we will offer a bonus. \nYou win this Mission, by WINNING a season of Total Drama! Yes, even if you lose on Island, you still will have a chance again, and again to repeat until you get it before you can leave! Fair warning there are 6 seasons with the most recent coming out over a decade after the past one. Meaning if you don't get the win, you will be trapped in this world FOREVER! Or at least until you get a new mission once you officially lose all the seasons which again is going to be easily 16 years. Long enough to raise and train a kid into a Total Drama expert in hope of them winning.\n\nOh, and before we forget. You are not allowed to kill or capture your fellow Contestants or Host/Staff during the show, after is fair game as long as it is not during a direct transom between seasons meaning the soonest you can get away with murdering Chris for putting you through this shit is post Total Drama Action unless you win and decide to close the mission then go for it! Same with if you want to finally officially capture one of the various Waifu in this world. \n\nStill if you want to try your luck and play the game. After the first Successful Win you can leave, or you can try again and get a bonus 50 credit per extra season won! Oh, and we will double any season credit winnings if you do it without using ANY powers or give away the fact you are not human. That's a possible 600 credits if you somehow talk them into getting on the newest season or convince them you are your own son. \nWhy so much? Honestly this series is more than a little on the side of torture and we heavily encourage you to NOT use any powers to make things easier for you. If you win all of this without getting voted off by your fellow contestants who KNOW you as a threat especially after that first win then you more than earned it!\n\nThe real question here is if you are game or not?",

Monsters and traps are generated by your fetishes (whether you know your into them or not), and loot is based on your preferred methods of fighting (Enchanted items that boost magic powers or weapons made of special material for close combat fighters (Do note, some items may have secondary enchantments with lewd effects like increasing breast size or giving new fetishes like a desire for bondage)). For the duration of your time inside the dungeon you cannot die permanently, If you should somehow meet your end, you will be transported back to the start of the dungeon and must restart. Monsters will not actively kill you, but will instead try to rape and breed with you. If you should be captured and breed for longer than a single pregnancy period it will count as a \"Death\" and trigger a restart. I wish you luck with this dear Contractor~",

You're still allowed to capture other companions as members of your retinue, they're just limited to their world of origin until you complete the 10-world-circuit. \n\nPlus, you'll be rewarded handsomely at the end of it if you manage to stick to the restrictions!",

Its Dust-based vehicles are magitech at their core, which, after some simple (and cheap) adjustments, makes them useful in wide range of magical or technomagical universes. However, due to Remnant's general situation - Grimm and proper mass production do not align - the amount of vehicles in the world is lower than you would expect, leading to their comparative shortage.\n\nYour task will be simple, Contractor - go to one of RWBY world-lines and perform an acquisition run."

Besides, from the Old Ones and co. the Company can extract some of its most luxurios and expensive products (You should see how fast and how high a single fertility pill made from the purified Essence of Shub-Niggurat is sold, you could buy an entire Universe for Yourself and another one for you wife and kid respectively).\n\nAs such the Company has decided to both profit from the selling of Outer Gods parts and at the same time to increase the entertainement of the investors by creating a new program called: The Hunt of the Outer Ones. Using one of the least used world that they have: the world of Cthulhu Tech.\n\nObviously as the name suggest some poor bastard will have to hunt them, and what better way to do so if not inside a giant Mech during an ALL OUT WAR between said otherworldy beings!\n\nThe mission is simple: Select the world of Cthulhu Tech as your Starter World, Take a fucking huge mech and finally go Hunting some squid face.\nOnce you take this mission the Aeon War will start in one month, and this time is going to be a one for all Battle Royale, as almost all the Gods of the Mythos will start to increase the activity of their respective cults to fight against you.\nHope you are strong enough to survive and mad enough to even try. We, The Company, seriously cherish the value of the entertainement you can provide to us, or at leasdt try not to die instantly (it is all for the sake of the score)."

And the place they chose to try and activate is the The Fate/Redline Holy grail. Suffice to say, it had a meltdown, cutting the war a bit short. Now the idiot has gotten his very being infused into the grail, meaning that the little meltdown it had to cause this is most definitely going to repeat, and when it does this time, the backlash may actually reach 'The Company'.\nGood news, that version of the 'verse is still there, though not for to much longer. Bad News, all the ambient mana and messing with the throne has resulted in dozens more servants arriving. And for the cherry on top, all the servants are ones who've been exposed to the dreaded, 'GUDAGUDA' particles, something even a few of our Tier Y rated counselors have thrown their limbs up trying to understand(Servants from Any GUDAGUDA event and Koha-Ace are the most likely to be summoned). Did I also mention they've all gotten a significant power boost(+1 tier in strength), will be able to respawn so long as the grail keeps pumping mana into this failed timeline and have messed up reality enough that the area around the Grail is simultaneously 1945 Imperial Japan, the Bakumatsu period, The Beginning of the Edo period, the Sengoku Jidai and even Yayoi period Japan.\nSilver lining, all the masters are dead, but we have enough pull to assign you a few command seals and send you in. Enter in there, prevent the grail from going critical and damaging 'Company' hardware, and if you can, see if you can figure out just how exactly this idiot did this and why.",

They no longer search for knowledge, they just simply know, seeing the whole picture.\n\nThere are several limitations. For one, the being must know what they are looking for, and it takes many millions of years to acquire, and some beings only have Intellectus on specific subjects; such as Demonreach on its island and the Naagloshii on torture.\n\nIt has been noted that Demonreach is impressive for achieving Intellectus of its limited domain in just its (relatively) short existence. Your job is to achieve an even more limited domain in an even more limited scope: come to know yourself, whole and as one, simply knowing your body as your mind as your soul.",

Experience the vulnerability of losing oneself.\n\nSoul Concealment:\n   - Temporarily shroud the color and brilliance of your soul, confounding Freya and hindering her ability to discern your true intentions and emotions.\n   - Possess the skill to deceive not only mortal minds but also Gods and other lie detectors.\n\nIllusory Soul:\n- Project a mesmerizing illusion of your soul that caters to the desires of any entity, allowing you to appear as the epitome of purity or embrace an opposite, darker nature.\n- Utilize this power to become the ideal candidate for any soul judgment, but be cautious, for as your soul adapts to please entities, it may evolve into a form fundamentally different. Navigate the delicate balance as your soul transforms in pursuit of perfection or veers towards an alternate, more sinister path.\n\nDivine Disruption:\n- Temporarily disrupt divine energies, offering a pathway to liberate victims from long-standing charms.\n- In cases where the charm has woven a profound connection, freeing the victim may reveal complex emotions. While breaking the enchantment, be prepared for the emotional aftermath, as those charmed may grapple with feelings developed during the enthrallment, forcing them to confront a reality without the influence of the charmer.\n\nBe careful, success in the mission may liberate Freya's victims, but it risks plunging Orario into a tumultuous aftermath marked by internal strife, external threats, and the unpredictable consequences of disrupting a goddess's carefully crafted domain.",

Worlds where nature has been destroyed, suffocated by war, poison, industrialization or sheer evil. Where fresh fruit is a luxury only the super rich could ever hope to taste. Where the air is suffocating from radiation or toxic pollution. And we want you to change things in such a world. Not in subtle and incremental ways, we want you to overturn the foundations of the genre, a green revolution so to speak. From deserts of sand and concrete, to forests and flower fields, cleaned oceans and rivers, a world that can finally breathe again. You can help the locals and create an ecosystem that works symbiotically with them, or go full revenge on mother nature and destroy them. We are happy to let you pick.",

Once you gathered up the data for whichever monster, soldier, or robot you want to use, you can print them out and compete against other players with them.  Well, when I put it like that, our entire gimmick is that we've moved past cards...  Still, it's great fun, I promise!\n\nIn any event, in something of a bribe to try and convince you to attend, I've got a small number of Aether Spirits for you to set you a team, and a small handful of chips to help you start strategizing.  I hope to see you there - and, uh, I've been instructed to tell you that this particular event is NOT being hosted on Belebog.  I'm not actually sure where that is?  ",

    "desc": "The sprawling Dungeon City of Orario holds a unique allure for contractors, with its mysteries and depths often overshadowed by distractions like Waifu Chasing. However, the Dungeon's intrigue deepens significantly as one ventures further into its uncharted territories.\n\nIn this altered version of the canon, a century prior to the established canon, a meteorite carrying a peculiar crystal descended into Lolog Lake near the fishing city of Melen. Submerged for several years, the crystal, resembling a pink gem containing what appears to be a miniature black hole, resonated with the Dungeon's energy. Surprisingly, it traversed the earth, evading the Leviathan Seal in the lake, and found its way into the Dungeon. Monsters, slightly empowered by its presence, transported it to the deepest floors, where it now rests on an altar guarded by mutated creatures.\n\nRecently, the crystal has exhibited unusual behavior and started accumulating power following the defeat of the Zeus and Hera Familias. To prevent catastrophic consequences, a mission has been proposed: reach the Dungeon's abyss, destroy the crystal with an Ultimate Attack, causing the black hole to dissipate. The urgency arises from the fact that the crystal, if left unchecked, will unleash its power, reviving Behemoth and Leviathan while amplifying the One-Eyed Black Dragon's strength by 1.5 and healing its previous injuries. If the Dragon was previously defeated, it will be resurrected at 75% of its original power alongside the other beasts.\n\nAlternatively, adventurers can choose a riskier yet potentially rewarding path. By touching the crystal, one can extend their consciousness to it and expedite the process. The revived Beasts will be weaker and the crystal's durability lowered. In doing so, the crystal can be retained and used as a reservoir of power, capable of reviving individuals up to Tier 10. However, exceeding this limit will result in the crystal's explosive demise, unable to contain the overwhelming power required. \nThe fate of the world hangs in the balance, with 450 days remaining before the crystal unleashes its destructive potential.\n\nYou will be cut off from Heritage, Rides, Demiplanes and Dungeons sections and Template Stacking we won't send you alone.\nTake this:\n\nSkill: Lover's Accelerated Destiny\n\nEmbark on an extraordinary journey with Lover's Accelerated Destiny, a skill that propels your leveling speed based on the challenges that await. Clear objectives become the fuel for swifter progression, while the absence of stat caps allows boundless growth.\n\nFate, however, weaves additional challenges into your path – trials you are destined to conquer, pushing you beyond your perceived limits. Embrace these challenges as stepping stones to unparalleled strength.\n\nThe impact of Lover's Accelerated Destiny extends beyond yourself. Friends and lovers become intertwined with your emotional cadence, following your pace. The closer they are to you emotionally, the more seamlessly they synchronize with the rhythm of your destiny. Together, face the challenges and ascend to unprecedented heights.\n\nSkill: Familial Echo\n\nForge unbreakable bonds within your Familia and unlock the power of Familial Echo. This skill grants you copies of every Development Ability possessed by your Familia members, creating a shared synergy that amplifies the strength of the entire group.\n\nHowever, trust and camaraderie are the key catalysts. Familial Echo thrives in an atmosphere of mutual respect and admiration. If met with feelings from apathy to hate by the members you seek to emulate, the echoes of their abilities remain elusive, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong connections within your Familia.\n\n\nIf you opt for the Drop-In Origin, you will find yourself materializing the day  of Bell's encounter with Ais. You'll be garbed in medieval peasant attire and equipped with a backpack containing spare clothes, a map, personal hygiene items (toothbrush, toothpaste, etc.) and multiple sets of underwear. Positioned one mile away from Orario, you'll have sufficient Valis to gain entry into the city and sustain yourself for a week, covering expenses for accommodation and meals, should you choose to lodge at Mamma Mia's inn. You get Paper Trail for Free for you and your retinue.\n\nIn the case of selecting the Extra Origin, your circumstances will be similar to the Drop-In but instead of appearing out of thin air, your origins will trace back to a random village. This change arises after the unfortunate demise of your family, prompting you to embark on the path of becoming an adventurer. You will carry a modest dagger and don a medieval peasant attire beneath a worn leather chest piece, along with any additional items that this supplementary character has brought along."

This is an event the Company holds regularly for the entertainment of our patrons, where seven Contractors face each other in mortal combat. Now surely, you’re likely confused about what makes this Holy Grail War so special, considering you can find thousands of Contractors participating as Masters in a Holy Grail War at any given time. But it’s really quite simple: the Contractors are the Servants, not the Masters!\n\nYou and six other Contractors will be summoned to a random world to act as Servants for seven characters native to that world. This world's Danger Rating will be no higher than your Tier, but it can be anywhere below it. It will not count for the purposes of Exit Stage Left or Calming Up. Everyone’s knowledge of the world will be the same. While it is highly recommended you have some experience before taking this mission, it isn’t required.\n\nWho your Master is will be based on your personality and compatibility, and Universal Calibration will be applied free of charge so your Master reflects your preferences. All things considered, it SHOULD be relatively easy to get a love confession from them, though we make no guarantees. A free Template Stacking I and II will be applied to you for a Servant Class determined by your personality and abilities; unless you purchase it yourself you do not keep this TS after the mission. You will have your own unique Parameters, Skills, and Noble Phantasms. If you already have Template Stacking for a canon Servant, then you will be summoned into one of that Servant’s canon Classes unless a different one is more eligible overall.\n\nYour enemies will be roughly equal to you in power, skill, and experience, though you are all capped at Tier 10. For example, all enemy Servants will have the same Tier and Origin type as you. If you used Power Swap, your opponents will also have Power Swapped to a character of the same Tier. If you have a Heritage, the others will have one too. Lastly, if you Substituted, Possessed, or TSed a canon Nasuverse character, then so will your opponents. This is to make sure everyone is on even ground when it comes to True Name discernment.\n\nUpon winning or losing, you will be sent back to wherever you were when you accepted this mission, with any physical, mental, and spiritual injuries sustained during the War healed as if nothing ever happened. Any Companions or Familiars acquired will be teleported back with you.\n\nIf any rules are broken, then a veteran Contractor will be summoned as an independent Ruler Class Servant. They will also have seven of their retinue members with them, each one with a different Servant Class. Their Lures and Command Seals will work on you without hindrance, but they can't Capture you excluding the exceptions below.\n\nNow, with all the boring legalities out of the way, let the Company Holy Grail War begin!",

Thus they are extremely skilled at all manner of sexual combat, using drugs, magic and sheer skill to destroy their targets either through death or by breaking their minds and bodies through pleasure. They prefer the latter but will do the former if no other way is available. Fortunately, we have managed to get in contact with them and they are willing to take an “assassination” job for us. If you are willing to take this mission, we will give them the mission to target you in specific. Simply speaking, their origin and biology makes it hard to get a proper grasp on their powers, but we believe that if you defeat the targets using the power of ahegao and mind breaking pleasure, their resistance should be temporarily gone and we can learn a lot from them.That said, you can first beat them up if you want.

And yet for all that, when 4 brats and 1 rather nice boy entered, the ones who walked out didn't seem to have learned their lesson in this humble assigner's opinion.\n\nYour mission, should you accept it, is to replace Willy Wonka; Insert, Stack-and-ID-steal, Capture-and-control, or even just hack the Factory's systems, doesn't matter; the point is that you have to be in a position of power over the factory, power enough to send out no fewer than 5 and no more than 50 Golden Tickets, the machine able to print them located somewhere in the Factory for you to find or be told the location of depending on which route to power you take.\n\nOnce created, these Tickets will magically find their way to \"beastly\" children and the odd good apple at a rate of 4:1 from across Dahl's works --- and here I should note that you will be able to set the parameters of the combined world you go to, able to combine different adaptations from the original books to classic and modern non-/animated films depending on your personal tastes --- who will be literally enchanted with the idea of visiting the Factory come hell, high water or interdimensional travel needs.\n\nOnce the children and their grand/parental figure{s} arrive, it will be up to you to take their measure, assuming you don't already know them from their own tales (some of which may have already happened per your choice in timeline, e.g. Matilda may be living with her birth-parents and brother {and oh my, is that a +1 on their Ticket? Must've been a lucky misprint, trololol} or new Headmistress Ms. Honey), and punish or reward them accordingly ... of course, you could be a typical Dahl Adult and simply run the lot of them through the mill or swing the other way and try to reform the bad while rewardign the good, but where's the fun in that?\n\nDepending on whether you have usurped Mr Wonka's place or are mererly using magic / machines to upstage his control of the situation, you may have to put in more work for some than others, esp. as the Client wants all good / bad ends or moral lessons to be food-based and will award extra points the closer to confectionary you make the performance, e.g. they will barerly accept Veruca Salt going down the rubbish chute in the Nut or Goose Egg room per script, but were deeply dissatisifed that Mike Teevee's fate didn't even include a food-based commercial in favour of pure shrinkage and anti-telly messaging --- and I assure you, the Client WILL be watching and judging your performance via Company Broadcast.\n\nSo, with that out of the way, allow me to fondly send you on your path ... to Willy Wonka's Wonderful Whirligig Works! ... or whatever you may decide to re/name it.

Lovecraft has two main themes: Cosmic horror, and the incomprehensible and unimaginably powerful Outer Gods that embody that horror.\n\nTherein lies the problem: This is not good for business. Contractors have an annoying tendency to not want to die, but also desire the power possessed by the Waifus of Lovecraft's Mythos. While this means we can jack up the prices for them significantly, getting more is always a nightmare, since no one wants to do the dirty work.\nThat's where you come in. We're experimenting with a new format of Godly Waifu hunting to increase recruitment rates, and you're our test subject. You signed up, didn't you? If you haven't, well... It's a bit late for regrets.\n\nWe have dedicated a local omniverse to 'Cute True Form' tests, of which we've decided you will be sent to participate in. Other tests are occurring, of course, you're just not liable to survive the 'sexually voracious' or 'heavy porn physics' ones. Mortality rates have shifted us towards less overt Capture-encouragement method experiments. Maybe if you do paticularly well we'll let you take a peek at the others.\n\nThe main change we're testing with you is that, instead of 'tenticled, planet sized ball of flesh' being the natural form of Lovecraftian Deities, 'Cute Girl' has instead become the default. They can still assume their cosmic horror forms, it is simply not their most comfortable or natural. All Deities are guaranteed to possess both forms, though personal usage of either is dependant heavily on the paticular Waifu and their quirks.\n\nFor Participating in this Test, take 150 credits for Chargen or normal use(credits for this mission are given upon selection rather then completion). It's enough for a few defenses, though we recommend far more. Or not, seeing how their psyche has changed with respect to insolent or dangerous humans, now that they're more naturally empathetic with humans, will be similarly valuable test data. Though you likely won't survive the process... Just because they're cute doesn't mean they're any less dangerous. We hope this isn't news to you.\n\n\nAs an aside, while we don't demand you capture even a decent amount of T10+ waifus, at least 1 is required to judge for this test, so you may not leave the universe until this task is completed. If you're regretful, maybe don't sign untitled waivers. In the Company, it's typically a bad idea(though of course we thank you for participating anyway).\nPlease, don't feel obligated to completely capture every Waifu in this universe, we're looking for eagerness data rather then capture data, here.",

Madan no Ou to Vanadis, Seikoku no Ryuu Kishi, Saijaku Muhai no Bahamut, and Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance, all of the previously mentioned works are but a couple of examples of what this bland, generic, and overexploited genre can offer for you.\n\nBut we are not here to talk about tastes, Contractor. We are here to talk about business.\n\nNot too long ago, a bunch of Nascent Gods got the bright idea of holding a couple of interdimensional tournaments to earn themselves a bit of clout among their older, more experimented peers. Each of these tournaments will represent a different Concept, something to distinguish it from your average multiversal contest.\n\nIn this particular case, the Concepts in question are \"Fantasy\", \"Battle Harem\", and \"Royal Battle\".\n\nThey have Shangai'd from their home worlds the protagonists of many stories featuring the first two concepts, along with the most prominent members of their harems, and have been set to fight in groups against their fellow kidnapping victims from other works in a different dimension, all for the for the not-so-small prize of an omnipotent, reality-altering Wish if they come out as the victors of this game. \n\nA one-week-long affair filled with relentless fights against the competition, all set in a sea of limitless trees and crumbling buildings, devoid of any life other than the occasional small animal. \n\nSounds like a fun event, right? But there is a small, tiny little problem with all of this. You see, these upstarts wannabe ROB's?\n\nThey are on our shit list.\n\nThese fuckers have been talking trash about us for quite some time already. Usually, this kind of behavior wouldn't affect us in the slightest. I mean, what can they even do against us? Oppose us? Please. If we feel merciful, they would only become persona non grata in most civilized parts of the Omniverse. If they catch us in a bad mood, though... Well, we leave that to your imagination, Contractor.\n\nBut you see, these guys somehow managed to get in the good graces of a lot of influential people, all of them being more than willing to listen to their idiotic prattle about us. Thanks to them, we have lost a significant number of business partners and investors, enough of them to hurt our pockets.\n\nThe objective of your mission is pretty straightforward, Contractor. Make them pay. Due to their carelessness, we have discovered the method they plan to use to secure their participants. We are going to hijack it and register you as the Main Character of an obscure Light Novel, along with four retinue members of your choosing.\n\nYou're going in, roleplay as an average Light Novel protagonist with his haremettes for a while, and once the night of the second day falls... That's when the fun begins.\n\nYou are to go on a capture spree, while we run interference to prevent the assholes running this event from stopping you. You are to bind every Contestant you come across during this event until all of the remaining participants belong to your retinue. Once you have achieved that, we'll beam you out of there\n\nGive them hell, Contractor. Make them regret messing with us."

Instead of going to the vanilla, boring world of Pokémon, we instead are going to send you to its better and far superior variant, the wonderful World of Moemon!\n\nThis world is inhabited by creatures called Moemon. Powerful, fearsome, dangerous, but above all that, cute-looking beings that aren't that much different from their regular Pokemon counterparts, despite what their human-like appearance might suggest, inability to say anything more than their species' name included.\n\nFor some people, Moemon are pets. Others use them for fights. As for ourselves... We're going to sell them as glorified sex pets, of course! That's like, our whole schtick, Contractor!\n\nYour mission is pretty simple. We're dropping you in a region of your choosing, and then you'll have to live up to the old motto of 'Gotta Catch 'em all!'. You are to capture every single Moemon featured in the regional MoeDex, legendaries included, of course.\n\nBeyond that, it's up to you what you wish to do for the duration of the mission. Collect the eight badges, take the title of Regional Champion of the Moemon League for yourself, or beat up the regional Evil Team, we don't particularly care as long as you complete the main objective.\n\nUnfortunately, we couldn't procure the help of any of the Regional Professors, so too bad for you, it seems like you'll have to make do without a MoeDex or one of the usual three Starters on this occasion. Still, we're not without heart, so to compensate you for the lack of local support, you will be given a modified basic MoeBall with a guaranteed 100% Capture Rate so you can capture your first partner by yourself, Regional Starters be damned.\n\nWe have to warn you though that it will only work as a functional Master Ball for around 60 minutes after your insertion, and it WILL lose the increased Catch Rate if you even try to capture a Moemon with another MoeBall, so we recommend you use it right away if you can.\n\nOther than that? Go nuts. This timeline is pretty much a carbon copy of that of the games. Make of that what you will.\n\nContractor! Your very own Moemon legend is about to unfold! A world of dreams and adventures with Moemon awaits! Let's go!",

Rapists, killers, sociopaths, psychopaths, villains, genociders. It doesn't matter how wrong or fucked up it might be. If you can name it, chances are that we have a whole division worth of it among our ranks.\n\nYet, despite all of our collective sins, there is one thing that surprisingly few of us can stand. We are talking of course, of bad parenting.\n\n...Yeah, we might have a complex with this, we admit it. How the hell do you think so many of us ended up working here in the first place? By growing up in a healthy and loving family unit? Don't make us laugh, Contractor.\n\n...Oh! The mission. Right. I nearly forgot about that.\n\nDo you remember Sephiroth? You know, white hair, long-ass Katana, black coat, ominous theme, the main antagonist from his game, that Sephiroth? Well, some of our employees believe that things would have played vastly differently if someone raised him properly instead of putting him through the whole lab rat experience, and as the good Patrons we are, we decided to test if their theory is true.\n\nWe were at first thinking of tweaking things a little on a variant of the setting to see what would happen in that scenario, but... Truth be told, Contractor? Out of every possible candidate, not even a single one of them meets the criteria for what it means to be a good parent under our standards.\n\nLucrecia? She used Sephiroth as a test subject while he was still in her womb. Vincent? He's currently occupied being comatic and roleplaying as a vampire. Hojo? ...Well, you've already seen how things played canon.\n\nSo, seeing how everyone who could have realistically taken care of baby Sephiroth doesn't have the mindset to be a good parent to him, we have decided instead to take care of this matter with our own hands. Or rather, your hands.\n\nWe'll drop you near the facility in which ShinRa is currently experimenting on Sephiroth, a month or so after his birth. You are to break in there, extract the infant Sephiroth, and leave without a trace.\n\nBut your mission doesn't end up there, Contractor. We're barely at the beginning of this ordeal.\n\nThat child you just rescued? You are to Adopt it and raise him as part of your family until he is of age. He will grow under your tender care, enjoying a happy and carefree childhood, living his youth to its fullest, all under the warm and loving gaze of a family that loves him. And after everything is said and done? He is to return to his homeworld, fully willing to challenge the World and become the Hero he was supposed to be.\n\nHe is to be aware of his original fate. Aware of what he was supposed to be, and he is to strive to become better than that. And if once he is of age he wants to join our Company as a Contractor, following the steps of his parent and continuing the familiar business? Even better for us.",

Which is fine but they aren’t even at war, they are just doing it for the sake of it! Now we want you to take a gander at overturning the status quo of things and showing the oh so mighty goddess her place beneath your heel. Just go all out and turn her into a proper onahole, you know what we mean. Crush the Goddess and her familia and show them who is really the boss. Now, to make things a bit more interesting there will be a small handicap, but I am sure it will be a fun little challenge.\n\nIn addition, we have a pair of new Perks we are experimenting with. They will unlock for use on Kali once you have had sex with her at least once. But you will need a bit more work to get them fully usable. They are called “Profane Acupressure” and “Heretical Acupuncture”. The first lets you increase someone’s physical sensitivity to pleasure up to 300 times for 24 hours using pressure points. The second lets you permanently increase their sensitivity up to 3000 times using acupuncture needles.",

There are Servants now running across the setting, for both good and ill.\n\nNow, we could have retrieved the Grails ourselves or something, but since you guys seem to be so desperate for a bit of amusement, we decided to make it a Mission instead.\n\nGo forth, travel across the Worlds, retrieve the Grails, beat or capture the summoned Servants, and correct all of the...

Appears to be the result of poor energy regulation of the Miraculous she was using, the Peacock of Emotion. Should be pretty simple to handle, just drain whatever excess is in her system and give her a little boost to help her recover\n\nThis leads us directly to the second issue, the Peacock is broken. Should be simple to handle again. Just directly reestablish the link between the spirit and the jewelry\n\n But her main goal is the acquisition of the Black Cat and Ladybug Miraculous in order to make a wish. \n\nThis is a lot to ask for normally, but she's made it worth our while.\n\nShe's not only giving the Company herself (through you as a Contractor) she's also giving up the Peacock and Butterfly Miraculous, spirits bound to them included.\n\nWith the data from them, we'll be able to develop plenty of Aethermorphs and Outsiders.\n\nNow, some warnings before you go in.\n\nWe've noticed some...instability in the time stream, Paradox Defense is recommended.\n\nAlso, because of how the Wizard created the Miraculous, Company based teleportation won't work on them unless you hold them on your person and have activated them. \n\nThey also effectively insulate their holders from being Captured by a Company Binding.\n\nAnd one last thing to keep in mind is that Miraculous holders are considered metaphysically distinct from their transformed counterparts.

Sometimes it's nobody's fault, sometimes it's everyone's fault, but regardless of why it occurred, the fact remains it did so. \nNormally, the Company could care less what happens to surviving lost Companions, but every now and then, a collection of such individuals forms and decides, for whatever reasons, to begin a policy of total intolerance for attempted Company operations in whichever reality they've settled in.\nBeing fair, even this wouldn't normally be cause for alarm, but sometimes, as is the case now, these groups settle in particularly abundant variant realities, filled with an incredible number of highly desirable Waifus and/or Husbandos. As such, the Company needs them to stop being a problem, which is where the Patrons come in.\nThese Lost Companion Collectives, for reasons yet unknown, almost always consist near-exclusively of Companions that are of interest to one or more of the Patrons, so they gladly sponsor these Clean-Up Missions and Contractors for their own benefit.\nThis time the problem has come to a Variant Kingdom Hearts, one where just about every reality you can imagine exists within, either as a World that can be visited, or through variant versions of their populace spread throughout.\nThe Collective that has settled in this reality consists primarily of abused former Companions, tending to be either physically, emotionally, or psychologically scarred (or some combination thereof) former heroes or neutrals, and who are all T8-10 in power. As best as can be determined, there are 20 members of this group, but there may be more, if you can find them, and they are scattered throughout the Worlds. Naturally, their status has caught the eye of the Archangel of Benevolence.\nYour Mission, should you accept it, is to neutralise all these rogue former Companions, either by Capturing them, or by otherwise binding them to some form of unbreakable agreement to cease further interference with Company matters. The Angel will not tolerate Killing any of these rogues unless you have no other choice at the time, so unnecessary killings will result in failure.\n\nOh, and the Angel's decided that a perfect fit for this mission already exists in the World, so you'll have to either already be her, or to become her. Have Fun!"

Only 5% of males survived the purge, As such they are considered the most valuable and sought after resource in the world, although a powerful side-effect affecting their DNA caused low fertility rates and kept them from being cloned. Total societal breakdown and governmental collapses have occurred. With the fall of the civilized world, many women around the world have risen to the occasion becoming Peacekeepers, Heroes, and Just Rulers. While a lot more often than not has fallen to becoming Bandits, Warlords, and Dictators.\n\nThe women of the dc universe both major and minor have formed new factions, kingdoms and groups. A new Justice League has formed led out of the Hall of Justice by Wonder Women dedicated to peacekeeping and protecting civilians within their territory rather than fighting crime. Meanwhile out of the Titans Tower a group of former justice members has formed the Justice Lords led by Powergirl trying to maintain order in Jump City although with a more authoritarian touch. \n\nWhile many female villains have done the same, becoming powerful Warlords throughout the world. Lena Luthor has reformed the Legion of Doom to take advantage of the situation. Blüdhaven has completely fallen to hostile and deadly Plant Life. Gotham City has become the largest lawless haven in the world for slavers, gangs, murders, thieves, prostitutes, assassins, mercenaries, warlords, constantly vying for control of the city. Talia al Ghul and Lady Shiva have taken control of the League of Shadows, and have taken over parts of Western Asia. \n\nThe Supernatural side of the world has also been affected, now no longer hiding themselves from the world. Themyscira is under threat by literally everyone including the Olympians. Mera is left to rule Atlantis by herself and preparing to wage war, individuals such as Maxima, Trigon, Highfather, Mongul, Sinestro, Brainiac, Darkseid and Others have taken notice of earth's weakened state and are preparing to take advantage. And of course, there's what Amanda Waller is up to. \n\nTo say things, look bleak in an understatement, this is where you come in Contractor. Your goals are simple: Convert at least 50% of the female population to Tier 7 dragons and stabilize the male population for future generations. Forge a Dragon Army capable of repelling Justice League level threats and maintain order on earth for at least 15 years.",

Pick at least one randomly. You may take more for extra reward. The Contractor isn’t aware of this but will have to deal with the problem to guarantee a successful mission end.\n\n1. A mad scientist has released a mutagen that has started to transform the sealife into dangerous and lewd creatures. You will have to deal with an escalating amount of lewd monster attacks until the problem is dealt with.\n2. A magician who wants to weaken Academy City is setting up a spell to drain the intelligence of the beach’s visitors and steadily transform them into sex hungry bimbos. Any defenses you have will protect you but not the targets.\n3. A group of high-level students and faculty members from Tokiwadai are moving in to close the beach under the declaration that it is sinful and inappropriate for students.

After this mission is a complete, all pre-marked targets will have their stamps ramp up over the course of three days as per usual, but rather than do so all at once, they will do so one at a time in the order they were stamped, resulting in one capture every three days. This will only apply to pre-stamped targets and not targets stamped post mission completion. If you buy any other bindings before all of the ramp up periods are complete, the incomplete stamps will disappear and you will need to use your new binding instead.\n\nOptionally, you may also purchase a tier three, 15 credit, version of Memorabilia to have as many, or as few, of your beloved pets, living or dead, follow you into the New World as either a Felyne (Palico) or Canyne (Palamute) and serve as your official Palico(s)/Palamute(s) for this journey.

He was right actually, though not for any reasons he likely had. But there is something I believe to be equally as infinite, if far more rare. \nWillpower.\n\nI like to think that with enough grit, determination, and willingness to get back up, any challenge can be overcome. So why not test it then within the realm of Lordran(And Boletaria for good measure).\nYou will be Dropped-in to the setting at the original starting areas and with the goal of making your way to the end. You will be gifted with a free Everlasting Talent and Stress Defense(x2)(After all, we can't have you going hollow on us) and nothing else. Well, not nothing, you'll have a wooden club. Any purchases from the Company are still valid, but you will have no access to any baring Pocket space while actively on the duration of this mission. If any purchases have made you some form of beyond human existence, the body you will do this mission with will be a clone of who you once were, with your mind forced to operate it as it's soul vehicle until done.\n\nYou are free to gather, use and store any gear you pick up on the journey, as well as have full access to the leveling/strengthening systems of the respective worlds, which can further allow use of the casting systems of each world. Upon the completion of the cycle however, all gear and progress is lost when beginning the next.(Any gear gathered will immediately transfer to your pocket space upon you finishing that cycle, it will just be unavailable until the mission is over.)\n\nAnd just as a reminder of what you're fighting for, upon each cycles completion, you are allowed a full 48 hours in either your own purchased home, or within replica of your original world if you did not purchase a home, with access to all your Companions & other purchases. Use this time to rest, prepare, inform those who follow your of your trials(Regardless of the amount of time your take in each cycle, only a week will pass by in the realm they are in) and enjoy yourself. At the end of the 48 hours though, you will return to your mission in the next subsequent cycle. ",

It was only through a man(we shall call him Azor Ahai) who struck a deal with Us, the Company that he defeated the White Walkers and sealed them to the lands of Always Winter. It was Us that helped Bran the Builder build and enchant the Wall. It was Us that drained the Great Other of most of Its strength at great cost of our own. Now the Great Other is rising again, stronger than before with humanity almost magicless and unprepared. And that would be that, a planet smothered in Night and Terror. Until a clerk digging through files found a second contract from Azor Ahai. He added a clause to our deal that we are obligated to obey. It seems that Azor Ahai wrote that should the Great Other not be defeated and that the White Walker are to return, We The Company would return as well to snuff out this cold. Should you choose to accept this mission there is no backing out. It's either Victory or Death."

Your primary purpose is to ensure Taylor Hebert finds success and happiness in life. Good luck.\nYou are acting as Taylor's power. This has a number of different effects — you cannot directly countermand her instructions, although you can creatively interpret them. Additionally, you can't simply solve things in the background without her knowing, and you aren't allowed to intentionally escalate past Taylor. Until she willingly has you kill, maim, or use one of your Bindings or Master abilities you can't go around using them on your own.\nTaylor is immune to all forms of control, including Bindings and the memetic addictive effects of Lures. She is not immune to social manipulation, gaslighting, grooming, or any other more mundane methods of control if you're subtle and skilled enough to pierce her bubble of stubborn bullheadedness. She cannot be captured by any means until the mission is completed.\nDespite this, Taylor counts as a member of your retinue for all other purposes, including Talents, Heritage perks, Defenses, and other effects. You can freely purchase Template Stacking for her, although you can't Power Swap her to anyone else — you're her power, after all. Also, as you're acting as her power, she is of course without her canonical insect control ability.\nThe Mission does not count as complete until Taylor is truly and fully satisfied with her life. In most world lines, this will involve being a successful hero, but other good ends do exist for her depending on your nature and the choices you both make.\nMission Rewards:\nDue to the mission's duration and nature locking you to Taylor for an extended period, you do get some bonuses.\nFor the duration of your stay in Earth Bet, you will benefit from all defenses at a level of your choice. This is opt-in and can be fine-tuned to your personal desires.\nEvery time Taylor wins a cape fight, you receive a small sum of credits. This is subject to diminishing returns based on how significant the win is, so you can't simply grind the same street-level gangs for infinite budget.\nIf Taylor becomes part of a Cape Team, this rewards credits depending on the number, strength, and coherence of the team. Having a smaller, closer team is worth more than a massive loose collection. Social links matter. Taylor being or becoming the leader, officially or not, increases this value.\nYou cannot buy waifus for the duration of the mission.",

One of these have become a Higher up and has put this unique ongoing mission available to all and will not take up your Active Mission Slot. This Mission itself is simple, if a bit tedious in Execution. He wants Trophies of Original Waifus. Confused, let me explain. You know how some people have mounted heads of animals? Think like that only it includes the torso and some of the forearms and thighs, attached via bondage gear. Oh, and alive if empty in mind. Simple commands can still be followed. Anyway, to do this you will be given three syringes and a special knife with the same protections as the Company Stamp. You will inject one of the syringe's contents in the cervical spine of a willing or unconscious (sleeping or knocked out) waifu, waiting 60 seconds (tracked by your Smart Device) and then using the knife to sever the Waifus limbs. Once done they will be transported to either your Home or your Demiplane Home for you to place on a Trophy Plaque. The Syringes all scrub the waifus mind and two turn all internal organs (aside from those directly connected to the orifices) into standard flesh, the last just ensure the organs work without needing fed and watered. The Black Syringe also sterilises the womb, ensuring no children from any 'play' times. The Red Syringe instead makes it so the womb is fertile for a week and permanently lactate. The Blue Syringe just numbs the mind and allows you to get their organs if you wish. Of course, the syringes have infinite uses so you can experiment at your whim, although without Warranty Plan, you will lose any of your retinue as functioning members. As recompense, you can turn any leftovers (severed limbs at minimum) into useful items.",

You will be required to purchase 20 Entries from the catalog and relegate them to familiar status,  then drop them off in the right place so that when the lost Primarchs appear they can be each adopted by one of your familiars and raised to adulthood. You and whatever additional retinue you have are to minimize your involvement or even effects on the Primarchs, as well the Imperium at large, but otherwise what you do with the rest of your time is your own business. This does mean you may not simply eliminate the Imperium's enemies, as their struggle against them is paramount for the scenario.\n\nThe goal is for each Primarch to be a well adjusted member of the human civilization at the end of the Emperor's first great crusade. You get a full refund for each familiar if their adopted Primarch lives past that date, and you get bonus points equal to the full value for each Primarch that rebukes the temptations of Chaos and vows to protect humanity.

But as final bosses, they are of course destined to be defeated by a plucky band of heroes. Clearly, we are in need of a new breed of final bosses.\n\nYour mission, should you accept it, is to conquer the main continents of the Fire Emblem games: Archanea, Valentia, Jugdral, Elibe, Magvel, Tellius, Ylisse, Hoshido/Nohr/Valla, and Fodlan. You may choose to proceed in whatever order you'd like. For the continent of Magvel, you may choose between the Binding Blade timeline or the Blazing Blade timeline, or to conquer one then leap to a fresh World of the other. For the continent of Fodlan, you may choose between Three Houses or Three Hopes. Any future mainline games or spin-offs may be included at will.\n\nConquering a continent requires the subjugation of every country on it. This includes capturing or killing their leaders, pacifying the citizens, and ensuring no uprisings can occur. It does not necessarily require capturing the entire cast, although you may do so if you'd like.\n\nTo keep with the theme, this mission is only available to Contractors with the Dragon Heritage, including those with Ancestral Diversity. If a Contractor uses the Symbiote binding, units must be dragon-themed. And finally, to make it somewhat fair for the natives, weapons with increased potency against dragons similarly affect the Contractor, his retinue, and any Symbiote units, ignoring any Company Defenses.",

Most of our information from a specific setting comes from our Contractors, our Clients, our World Suppliers, or most of the time our employees from the Exploration & Tourism department, who have their own branch of freelancers workers doing the exploration and info gathering for us.\n\nAnd it is from them we got an important piece of information we might have overlooked in our initial forrays in this partcular World. Apparently in this setting, there are some very specific and limited set of abilities known as \"Authorities\" (Yes, we know the name sounds pretty generic, but it's not our fault this time) that, as far as we have seen, grants their user a special supernatural skill of their own, not unlike a Semblance in which it seems to be unique in nature, based on one of the \"sevens deadly sins\".\n\nSo if for example, you get the Authority of, say, Greed, chances are that you will get an ability heavily associated with the sin, like the ability to steal conceptual shit or mark things as yours pretty much like a second Binding, but less effective. There is a downside, though, because it SEEMS there is a correlation between the Authority's power and the mental sanity of the User. The more unhinged you are, the stronger your Authority will be.\n\nYour task is pretty simple, regardless of how easy I made it sound. You go in, capture all of the Archbishops of Sin plus anyone that holds an Authority by the moment of your insertion, and get out. And if you can capture anyone who seems to know something about the inner workings of a Witch Gene, it will be greatly appreciated.\n\nWe have to warn you though, this world is far more dangerous than how it might seem at a first glance. Don't get too cocky because their Tier is lower than what you would usually consider a threat to your life. Ram (HALF of a Tier 5 Waifu) was able to fight Roswaal L. Mathers to a standstill, Emilia might be holding an Authority of her own while having the Apocalypse itself as her familiar, Reinhard seems to embody the concept of \"Unfairness\" and Subaru might become your worst nightmare if you fuck things up.

Especially so since they might have valuable intel on the threats you may encounter on said world. \n\nAfter all, it is nearly impossible to predict what entity will cross over next, and some especially dangerous threats may have already passed through undetected due to all the distortions on site making any attempt at a comprehensive scan unreliable.  \n\nThe Greater WIll, along with other such powerful multiversal Outer Gods are interested in the situation and are watching. \nAnd while the Greater Will in particular doesn't mind others taking its damaged toys, it will very much get annoyed if you make too much of a ruckus while doing so.

Unfortunately it appears that this particular world lacks this most delicious of institutions. As such we would like to hire you to change that. For the purpose of this mission we want you to set up a proper slave market and kickstart the slave economy. You must produce quality ‘products’ and sell them to customers you consider worth the material. Unfortunately, slavery is currently not legal within Belzerg kingdom or its neighbors. Fortunately it appears that there is some loopholes in the current laws on slavery and forced labor involving monsters as they are legally not considered people and fair to kill at will. So enslaving monsters appears to be perfectly legal and there is a good chance that you can at least argue that other nonhumans like Elves also fall under that. Though the latter is likely to give you more outrage then the former. Still, it is likely that these laws will be adjusted after enough time passes, so we recommend that you make preparations for that.",

Saber Alter seemed fitting… I mean the aesthetics should fit with her darkness powers and all that. I thought that would be perfect.\n\nExcept it turns out the whole thing with Ex-Rumia wasn’t just a meme. Send help, she almost killed me when that damn ribbon came off. I think the power has driven her mad, but at least she hasn’t killed me. That said, she kinda chained me to the kitchen and is currently trying to burn down Gensokyo to stop anyone from stealing me, together with some other waifus of mine she has scared into submission. A few other girls got away and I think they may be trying to get help from the locals… I think she may have also affected some of them with the grail mud corruption from the Alter power-up...

But it is a twisted world, for its inhabitants are flawed in their perfection, hearts pure and innocent, yet that very thing makes them terrifying. Like children that may kill ants in amusement, they follow their instincts regardless of the consequences, even if doing so will be their own undoing. In this land, there rules a cold jaded tyrant queen that once upon a time was pure and hopeful. At her side stand her knights and army, trying to keep Fairy Britain functional in an endless struggle. For the very world considers the existence of this world a crime and continuously spills forth curses and evil to destroy it. Others rise up to challenge her reign, from would-be rebels over these that challenge her right to the throne. And a child of prophecy will rise to redeem the fae in the eyes of Gaia, even as that very act will surely erase the very world in which she lives in favor of a world that was denied long ago. Well, we say fuck all that shit. Your job is simple and straightforward. We will insert you some years before the canon events of Fate/Grand Order into Fairy Britain and then you must take over. Subjugate the Fairies, take over as ruler for Morgan and make the realm yours by taking out any competitors left around. It will be a struggle, as there are many other factions trying to gain power or undermine the current ruler already and you are unlikely to be more welcome than Morgan. Not to mention the capricious and innocently cruel nature of the fairies themselves. You will need to truly make them understand that you are in charge, in every way possible.",

Their people gave up the ability to procreate in exchange for the power to defend themselves more effectively, and after the war was over, the surviving population turned themselves into raw energy to restore the devastated planet. Then followed the war with humanity, manipulated by their ancient enemy to weaken two potential foes. Now their princess stands alone, the last of her kind. Unless you interfere. Your purpose is simple, you must repopulate this ancient race together with her and regain their lost glory. Only when VIRM is defeated and Klaxo Sapiens once again stands at the top of the food chain will your job be done. For the purpose of this mission you may either be inserted up to 50 years before canon, or you may use another world for repopulation while the canon world will be frozen in time for the same amount of time.",
