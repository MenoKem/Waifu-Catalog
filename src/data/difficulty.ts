export const difficultyRules = `<h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Negotiations (Difficulty)</h3>
<p>The options in this section will permanently alter your contract, affecting the potency of company perks and how you interact with the worlds you visit - drastically changing your employment experience with the company. All difficulty selections are both chargen-only and permanent, with the explicit exception detailed below. To find your intensity value, add the value of each selected option, plus a base value of 1.</p>
<p>Intensity has a hard lower limit of 0: if your calculated intensity is below 0, you must take additional options that add intensity until the value is within the allowed range.</p>
<p>Intensity has a soft upper limit of 10. If your calculated intensity is above 10, you do not need to take additional options to lower your intensity. It will simply be capped at 10 for your starting budget and payment values.</p>

<h4 class="font-bold text-lg">Intensity Buybacks</h4>
<p>Once you’ve been an active contractor for six months (180 days), you will earn the ability to pay off all difficulty settings that add intensity, to a minimum of +0 in each category. This will remove the difficulty effect, without lowering the values of your captures and sales. The fee for this is 500 credits per point of intensity, plus an additional 500 credits per point you’ve previously paid off: 500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, etc. If you pay off multiple intensity points at once, each point will be counted separately.</p>

<h4 class="font-bold text-lg">Intensity Options</h4>
<p>Unless specifically noted, each option within a subsection is mutually exclusive.</p>

A member of your retinue may be a companion to one of you and merely a familiar to the other.

    <p>You will only pay for the more expensive of your two Origins. The chosen binding method treats you as equal masters, ensuring that your love never fades. (If you have the Symbiote, one of you will usually, but not necessarily, be the queen.) Heritages are purchased separately, but the other of you can buy any Heritage that one of you has at half-price, after all discounts and ignoring the usual discount cap. This does not apply to the IMG costs of Heritage capstones.
    </p>
    <p>The control aspects of Bindings, Lures, and any Heritage hierarchy mechanics will only affect your relationship if the two of you are into that. Template Stacking and relevant waifu perks are purchased individually. All other items need only be purchased once to benefit the both of you equally.

    <p>Your signing bonus… isn’t. Whatever you spend from it will instead be a loan, subject to the rules in Loans and Credit Debt. Your starting world will not necessarily have enough available credits to pay back your loan or even the interest, but Missions and Invasion PvP can help cover that. Your baseline interest rate will also increase to 20%.</p>
    <p>Budgets below the starting loan limit for your intensity will experience an effective increase to that limit using the Loan rules. Budgets above that limit will be overcapped until you’ve paid enough of the principal to fall beneath the limit and/or visited enough new worlds to raise the limit above your principal. No additional loans may be taken while overcapped.
    </p>
    <p>Note that the budget-based caps on Substitute, Yoink, and other options will follow the original budgets for each Danger Rating and intensity.</p>

While your starting budget is not negatively impacted, from here on out, you can only gain credits for completing missions, winning arranged PvP matches, or by completing other similar activities on behalf of the company. All credit and ticket income from captures and sales will instead be converted into cold, hard cash, at a rate of 1 credit to 500 USD, in addition to the standard monetary bonus. Captures will still provide their rebates to Defense costs, as appropriate. We do not advise taking Cash Still Rules with this, as that mode provides no benefits with this mode active. However, if you wish to start heavily indebted to us, without any easy ways of paying us back… we won’t stop you.',

The Danger Rating of every world you visit will always be equal to the highest Danger Rating of any world your retinue has visited (while they were in your retinue). This even applies to worlds you’ve already been to since your contract began, but not different eras of the same world, and may manifest as a new plot development, incursion from one of your other worlds, or reveal of a new element that was “always” there. People from each adjusted world will maintain their former roles in the new circumstances, with appropriate increases to their tier ratings and list prices - and, in turn, the corresponding effects on capture and other values - as necessary. Waifu perks may still be applied to captures or Yoinks from these worlds, with no change to their list prices. Tier changes from waifu perks may or may not apply in these cases.',
